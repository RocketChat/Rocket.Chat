- Marketplace sort filter ([#24567](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/24567))

  Implemented a sort filter for the marketplace screen. This component sorts the marketplace apps list in 4 ways, alphabetical order(A-Z), inverse alphabetical order(Z-A), most recently updated(MRU), and least recent updated(LRU). Besides that, I've generalized some components and types to increase code reusability, renamed some helpers as well as deleted some useless ones, and inserted the necessary new translations on the English i18n dictionary.
  Demo gif:

### 🚀 Improvements

- Add return button in chats opened from the list of current chats ([#24458](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/24458) by [@LucasFASouza](https://github.com/LucasFASouza))

  The new return button for Omnichannel chats came out with release 3.15  but the feature was only available for chats that were opened from Omnichannel Contact Center.
  Now, the same UI/UX is supported for chats opened from Current Chats list.

  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32396925/153283190-bd5c9748-c36b-4874-a704-6043afc7e3a1.png)

  The chat now opens in the Omnichannel settings and has the return button so the user can go back to the Current Chats list.

- Purchase Type Filter for marketplace apps and Categories filter anchor refactoring ([#24454](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/24454))

  Implemented a filter by purchase type(free or paid) component for the apps screen of the marketplace. Besides that, new entries on the dictionary, fixed some parts of the App type (purchaseType was typed as unknown and price as string), and created some helpers to work alongside the filter. Will be refactoring the categories filter anchor and then will open this PR for reviews.

- Regression: No audio when call comes from Skype/IP phone ([#24602](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/24602))

  The audio was not rendered because of re-rendering of react element based on
  queueCounter and roomInfo. queueCounter and roomInfo cause the dom to re-render when call gets accepted
  because after accepting call, queueCounter changes or a room gets created.
  The audio element gets recreated. But VoIP user probably holds the old one.
  The behaviour is not predictable when such case happens. If everything gets cleanly setup,
  even if the audio element goes headless, it still continues to play the remote audio.
  But in other cases, it is unreferenced the one on dom has its srcObject as null.
  This causes no audio.

  This fix provides a way to re-initialise the rendering elements in VoIP user
  and calls this function on useEffect() if the re-render has happen.

- Regression: Fix incompatibility of apps http requests ([#24276](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/24276))

  HTTP GET and HEAD requests made with an empty object as `data` were breaking, as the bridge converted this to the request's body as `'{}'` but meteor's new lib doesn't allow for body content on either of this request methods.

  To maintain compatibility, we forced an empty body whenever we have a GET or HEAD request. This was probably the case previously, with the body of requests made with this methods being ignored either before being sent or in the third party server receiving the request

- Wrong button for non trial apps ([#23861](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/23861))

  This PR solves a bug on the marketplace that was happening with WhatsApp where it was displaying a trial button even though it didn't have a free trial period. The new verification I've added checks if the app is subscription-based and then checks if it has 0 trial days in all of its tiers. If it does, it shows a subscribe button. If it doesn't, it displays a trial button. Also, I've exposed the itsEnterpriseOnly flag as an extra measure in the case of apps like Facebook Messenger that are enterprise-only and consequently should show the subscribe button.

  > Code is bad. It rots. It requires periodic maintenance. It has bugs that need to be found. New features mean old code has to be adapted.
  > The more code you have, the more places there are for bugs to hide. The longer checkouts or compiles take. The longer it takes a new employee to make sense of your system. If you have to refactor there's more stuff to move around.
  > Furthermore, more code often means less flexibility and functionality. This is counter-intuitive, but a lot of times a simple, elegant solution is faster and more general than the plodding mess of code produced by a programmer of lesser talent.
  > Code is produced by engineers. To make more code requires more engineers. Engineers have n^2 communication costs, and all that code they add to the system, while expanding its capability, also increases a whole basket of costs.
  > You should do whatever possible to increase the productivity of individual programmers in terms of the expressive power of the code they write. Less code to do the same thing (and possibly better). Less programmers to hire. Less organizational communication costs.

  — <cite>[Rich Skrenta][1]</cite>

  Mixing two problem domains in code is prone to errors. In this small example

  ```ts
  declare const y: { z: unknown } | undefined;

  const x = y && y.z;
  ```

  we're (1) checking the nullity of `y` and (2) attributing `y.z` to `x`, where (2) is _clearly_ the main problem we're solving with code. The optional chaining is a good technique to handle nullity as a mere implementation detail:

  ```ts
  declare const y: { z: unknown } | undefined;

  const x = y?.z;
  ```

  Attributing `y.z` to `x` is more easily readable than the nullity check of `y`.

  This PR aims to add `@typescript-eslint/prefer-optional-chain` rule to ESlint configuration at warning level.

### 🐛 Bug fixes


- Error when creating an inactive user in admin panel ([#23859](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/23859))

  - Fix `usersInRole` array used to send email to activate a user.

- Segmentation fault on CentOS 7 due to outdated `sharp` ([#23796](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/23796))

  Upgrades `sharp` to avoid a segmentation fault on CentOS 7 during startup related to `sharp.node` being loaded via `process.dlopen()`.

  Suggested as a fix for versions `4.0.x` and `4.1.x`.

- teams.removeMembers client usage ([#23857](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/23857))

- Wrong button for non trial apps ([#23861](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/23861))

  This PR solves a bug on the marketplace that was happening with WhatsApp where it was displaying a trial button even though it didn't have a free trial period. The new verification I've added checks if the app is subscription-based and then checks if it has 0 trial days in all of its tiers. If it does, it shows a subscribe button. If it doesn't, it displays a trial button. Also, I've exposed the itsEnterpriseOnly flag as an extra measure in the case of apps like Facebook Messenger that are enterprise-only and consequently should show the subscribe button.

### 🎉 New features


- Allow Omnichannel statistics to be collected. ([#23694](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/23694))

  This PR adds the possibility for business stakeholders to see what is actually being used of the Omnichannel integrations.

- Allow registering by REG_TOKEN environment variable ([#23737](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/23737))

  You can provide the REG_TOKEN environment variable containing a registration token and it will automatically register to your cloud account.  This simplifies the registration flow

- Audio and Video calling in Livechat ([#23004](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/23004) by [@Deepak-learner](https://github.com/Deepak-learner) & [@dhruvjain99](https://github.com/dhruvjain99))

- Enable LDAP manual sync to deployments without EE license ([#23761](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/23761))

  Open the Enterprise LDAP API that executes background sync to be used without any Enterprise License and enforce 2FA requirements.

- Permission for download/uploading files on mobile ([#23686](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/23686) by [@ostjen](https://github.com/ostjen))

- Permissions for interacting with Omnichannel Contact Center ([#23389](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/23389))

  Adds a new permission, one that allows for control over user access to Omnichannel Contact Center,

- Rate limiting for user registering ([#23732](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/23732) by [@ostjen](https://github.com/ostjen))

- REST endpoints to manage Omnichannel Business Units ([#23750](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/23750))

  Basic documentation about endpoints can be found at https://www.postman.com/kaleman960/workspace/rocketchat-public-api/request/3865466-71502450-8c8f-42b4-8954-1cd3d01fcb0c

- Show on-hold metrics on analytics pages and current chats ([#23498](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/23498))

### 🚀 Improvements


- Allow override of default department for SMS Livechat sessions ([#23626](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/23626) by [@bhardwajaditya](https://github.com/bhardwajaditya))

- Engagement Dashboard ([#23547](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/23547))

  - Adds helpers `onToggledFeature` for server and client code to handle license activation/deactivation without server restart;  
  - Replaces usage of `useEndpointData` with `useQuery` (from [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/));  
  - Introduces `view-engagement-dashboard` permission.

- Improve the add user drop down for add a user in create channel modal for UserAutoCompleteMultiple ([#23766](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/23766) by [@Jeanstaquet](https://github.com/Jeanstaquet))

  Seeing only the name of the person you are not adding is not practical in my opinion because two people can have the same name. Moreover, you can't see the username of the person you want to add in the dropdown. So I changed that and created another selection of users to show the username as well. I made this change so that it would appear in the key place for creating a room and adding a user.

- MKP12 - New UI - Merge Apps and Marketplace Tabs and Content ([#23542](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/23542))

  Merged the Marketplace and Apps page into a single page with a tabs component that changes between Markeplace and installed apps.

- Re-naming department query param for Twilio ([#23725](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/23725))

  Since the endpoint supports both, department ID and department Name, so we're renaming it to reflect the same. `departmentName` -> `department`

- Reduce complexity in some functions ([#23387](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/23387))

  Overhauls all places where eslint's `complexity` rule is disabled.

- Stricter API types ([#23735](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/23735))

  It:  
  - Adds stricter types for `API`;  
  - Enables types for `urlParams`;  
  - Removes mandatory passage of `undefined` payload on client;  
  - Corrects some regressions;  
  - Reassures my belief in TypeScript supremacy.

### 🐛 Bug fixes


- "to users" not working in export message ([#23576](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/23576) by [@ostjen](https://github.com/ostjen))

- **ENTERPRISE:** OAuth "Merge Roles" removes roles from users ([#23588](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/23588))

  - Fix OAuth "Merge Roles": the "Merge Roles" option now synchronize only the roles described in the "**Roles to Sync**" setting available in each Custom OAuth settings' group (instead of replacing users' roles by their OAuth roles);  
  - Fix "Merge Roles" and "Channel Mapping" not being performed/updated on OAuth login.

- **ENTERPRISE:** Private rooms and discussions can't be audited ([#23673](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/23673))

- Apps scheduler "losing" jobs after server restart ([#23566](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/23566))

  If a job is scheduled and the server restarted, said job won't be executed, giving the impression it's been lost.

  What happens is that the scheduler is only started when some app tries to schedule an app   - if that happens, all jobs that are "late" will be executed; if that doesn't happen, no job will run.

  This PR starts the apps scheduler right after all apps have been loaded

- Autofocus on search input in admin ([#23738](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/23738))

- Chore: Mocha testing configuration ([#23706](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/23706))

  We've been writing integration tests for the REST API quite regularly, but we can't say the same for UI-related modules. This PR is based on the assumption that _improving the developer experience on writing tests_ would increase our coverage and promote the adoption even for newcomers.

  Here as summary of the proposal:
  
  - Change Mocha configuration files:
    - Add a base configuration (`.mocharc.base.json`);
    - Rename the configuration for REST API tests (`mocha_end_to_end.opts.js -> .mocharc.api.js`);
    - Add a configuration for client modules (`.mocharc.client.js`);
    - Enable ESLint for them.  
  - Add a Mocha test command exclusive for client modules (`npm run testunit-client`);  
  - Enable fast watch mode:
    - Configure `ts-node` to only transpile code (skip type checking);
    - Define a list of files to be watched.  
  - Configure `mocha` environment on ESLint only for test files (required when using Mocha's globals);  
  - Adopt Chai as our assertion library:
    - Unify the setup of Chai plugins (`chai-spies`, `chai-datetime`, `chai-dom`);
    - Replace `assert` with `chai`;
    - Replace `chai.expect` with `expect`.  
  - Enable integration tests with React components:
    - Enable JSX support on our default Babel configuration;
    - Adopt [testing library](https://testing-library.com/).

- Chore: Rearrange module typings ([#23452](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/23452))

  - Move all external module declarations (definitions and augmentations) to `/definition/externals`;  
  - ~Symlink some modules on `/definition/externals` to `/ee/server/services/definition/externals`~ Share types with `/ee/server/services`;  
  - Use TypeScript as server code entrypoint.

- Chore: Remove duplicated 'name' key from rate limiter logs ([#23771](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/23771))

- App update flow failing in HA setups ([#23607](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/23607))

  The flow for app updates is broken in specific scenarios with HA setups. Here we change the method calls in the Apps-Engine to avoid race conditions

- LDAP users not being re-activated on login ([#23627](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/23627))

- Make Livechat Instructions setting multi-line ([#23515](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/23515))

  Since now we're supporting markdown text on this field (via this PR   - https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.Livechat/pull/648), it would be nice to make this setting multiline so users can have more space to edit the text

- optimized groups.listAll response time ([#22941](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/22941) by [@ostjen](https://github.com/ostjen))

  groups.listAll endpoint was having performance issues, specially when the total number of groups was high. This happened because the endpoint was loading all objects in memory then using splice to paginate, instead of paginating beforehand.

  Considering 70k groups, this was the performance improvement:

### 🐛 Bug fixes


- **APPS:** Communication problem when updating and uninstalling apps in cluster ([#23418](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/23418))

  - Make the hook responsible for receiving app update events inside a cluster fetch the app's package (zip file) in the correct place.  
  - Also shows a warning message on uninstalls inside a cluster. As there are many servers writing to the same place, some race conditions may occur. This prevents problems related to terminating the process in the middle due to errors being thrown and leaving the server in a faulty state.

- **ENTERPRISE:** Omnichannel agent is not leaving the room when a forwarded chat is queued ([#23404](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/23404))

- Admins can't update or reset user avatars when the "Allow User Avatar Change" setting is off ([#23228](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/23228))

  The settings logic has been improved as a whole.

  All the logic to get the data from the env var was confusing.

  Setting default values was tricky to understand.

  Every time the server booted, all settings were updated and callbacks were called 2x or more (horrible for environments with multiple instances and generating a turbulent startup).

  `Settings.get(......, callback);` was deprecated. We now have better methods for each case.

- Remove cordova compatibility setting ([#23302](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/23302) by [@ostjen](https://github.com/ostjen))

- Remove deprecated endpoints ([#23162](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/23162))

  The following REST endpoints were removed:
  
  - `/api/v1/emoji-custom`  
  - `/api/v1/info`  
  - `/api/v1/permissions`  
  - `/api/v1/permissions.list`

  - `getServerInfo`  
  - `livechat:saveOfficeHours`

- Remove Google Vision features ([#23160](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/23160))

  Google Vision features like "block adult images" or label detection were not being maintained and totally broken. So we decided to remove its feature and maybe in the future release the same features as an app.

- Remove old migrations up to version 2.4.14 ([#23277](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/23277))

  To update to version 4.0.0 you'll need to be running at least version 3.0.0, otherwise you might loose some database migrations which might have unexpected effects.

  This aims to clean up the code, since upgrades jumping 2 major versions are too risky and hard to maintain, we'll keep only migration from that last major (in this case 3.x).

- Stop sending audio notifications via stream ([#23108](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/23108))

  Remove audio preferences and make them tied to desktop notification preferences.

- Webhook will fail if user is not part of the channel ([#23310](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/23310))

  Remove deprecated behavior added by https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/18024 that accepts webhook integrations sending messages even if the user is not part of the channel.

  Starting from 4.0.0 the webhook request will fail with `error-not-allowed` error:

  ```
  {"success":false,"error":"error-not-allowed"}
  ```

### 🚀 Improvements


- **APPS:** New storage strategy for Apps-Engine file packages ([#22657](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/22657))

  This is an enabler for our initiative to support NPM packages in the Apps-Engine. 

  Currently, the packages (zip files) for Rocket.Chat Apps are stored as a base64 encoded string in a document in the database, which constrains us due to the size limit of a document in MongoDB (16Mb).

  When we allow apps to include NPM packages, the size of the App package itself will be potentially _very large_ (I'm looking at you `node_modules`). Thus we'll be changing the strategy to store apps either with GridFS or the host's File System itself.

- **APPS:** Return task ids when using the scheduler api ([#23023](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/23023))

  In the methods that create tasks (`scheduleRecurring` and `scheduleOnce`) return the `id` of the document created in the database so the user can cancel each task individually.

- Add missing pt-BR translations, fix typos and unify language ([#23176](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/23176) by [@gabrieloliverio](https://github.com/gabrieloliverio))

- Better text for auth banner ([#23256](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/23256) by [@g-thome](https://github.com/g-thome))

  Change the text in the banner warning for auth changes

- Canned response admin settings ([#23190](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/23190))

- Change log format to JSON ([#22975](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/22975))

- Change occurences of Livechat to Omnichannel in ES translations were applicable ([#23199](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/23199))

- Do not re-create General room on every server start ([#22957](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/22957))

  - Check the `Show_Setup_Wizard` Setting's value to control whether the general room should be created. This channel will only be created if the `Show_Setup_Wizard` Setting is 'pending'.

- Load code highlighting languages on demand and fixes on new message parser ([#23232](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/23232))

  Now we have this setting called 'Code highlighting languages list' where you can define the languages that you want to be loaded by default.

- Throw error if no appId is provided to useUIKitHandleAction ([#23221](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/23221))

- Use PaginatedSelectFiltered in department edition ([#23054](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/23054))

- Regression: Create new loggers based on server log level ([#23297](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/23297))

- Regression: Fix app storage migration ([#23286](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/23286))

  The previous version of this migration didn't take into consideration apps that were installed prior to [Rocket.Chat@3.8.0](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/releases/tag/3.8.0), which [removed the typescript compiler from the server](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/18687) and into the CLI. As a result, the zip files inside each installed app's document in the database had typescript files in them instead of the now required javascript files.

  As the new strategy of source code storage for apps changes the way the app is loaded, those zip files containing the source code are read everytime the app is started (or [in this particular case, updated](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/23286/files#diff-caf9f7a22478639e58d6514be039140a42ce1ab2d999c3efe5678c38ee36d0ccR43)), and as the zips' contents were wrong, the operation was failing.

  The fix extract the data from old apps and creates new zip files with the compiled `js` already present.

### 🐛 Bug fixes


- "Click to Join" button is not working if there are no muted users in the room ([#22871](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/22871))

  - Add check to `room.muted` array so as to cover the case in which it is `undefined`;

- Apps-Engine's scheduler failing to update run tasks ([#22882](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/22882))

  [Agenda](https://github.com/agenda/agenda), the library that manages scheduling, depended on setting a job property named `nextRunAt` as `undefined` to signal whether it should be run on schedule or not. [Rocket.Chat's current Mongo driver](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/22399) ignores `undefined` values when updating documents and this was causing jobs to never stop running as Agenda couldn't clear that property (set them as `undefined`). 
  This updates Rocket.Chat's dependency on Agenda.js to point to [a fork that fixes the problem](https://github.com/RocketChat/agenda/releases/tag/3.1.2).

- Close omnichannel conversations when agent is deactivated ([#22917](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/22917))

### 🐛 Bug fixes


- **ENTERPRISE:** Engagement Dashboard displaying incorrect data about active users ([#22381](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/22381))

  - Fix sessions' and users' grouping in the Engagement Dashboard API endpoints;
   - Fix the data displayed in the charts from the "Active users", "Users by time of day" and "When is the chat busier?" sections of the Engagement Dashboard;
   - Replace label used to describe the amount of Active Users in the License section of the Info page.

- **ENTERPRISE:** Make AutoSelect algo take current agent load in consideration ([#22611](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/22611))

- **ENTERPRISE:** Race condition on Omnichannel visitor abandoned callback ([#22413](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/22413))

  As you can see [here](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/blob/857791c39c97b51b5b6fd3718e0c816959a81c3b/ee/app/livechat-enterprise/server/lib/Helper.js#L127) the `predictedVisitorAbandonment` flag is not set if the room object doesn't have  `v.lastMessageTs` property. So we need to always make sure the `v.lastMessageTs` is set before this method is called.

  Currently the `v.lastMessageTs` is being set in [this](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/blob/857791c39c97b51b5b6fd3718e0c816959a81c3b/app/livechat/server/hooks/saveLastVisitorMessageTs.js#L4) (lets call this **hook-1**) hook which has `HIGH` priority
  and the `predictedVisitorAbandonment` check is inturn performed in [this](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/blob/857791c39c97b51b5b6fd3718e0c816959a81c3b/ee/app/livechat-enterprise/server/hooks/setPredictedVisitorAbandonmentTime.js#L5) (let call this **hook-2**) hook which is also `HIGH` priority.

  So ideally we'd except the **hook-1** to be called b4 **hook-2**, however currently since both of them are at same priority, there is no way to control which one is executed first. Hence in this PR, I'm making the priority of **hook-2** as `MEDIUM` to keeping the priority of **hook-1** the same as b4, i.e. `HIGH`. This should make sure that the **hook-1** is always executed b4 **hook-2**

- Admin page crashing when commit hash is null ([#22057](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/22057) by [@cprice-kgi](https://github.com/cprice-kgi))

  If the commit hash happens to be null, the administration page will still attempt to slice the value and display it. This causes the admin page to not display, and essentially crash the web app. This fixes it by checking for a null value first.

- Blank screen in message auditing DM tab ([#22763](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/22763) by [@ostjen](https://github.com/ostjen))

  The DM tab in message auditing was displaying a blank screen, instead of the actual tab.

  ### aditional fix :rocket:  
  - unnecessary `TeamsMembers` component removed

- Cannot create a discussion from top left sidebar as a user ([#22618](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/22618) by [@lucassartor](https://github.com/lucassartor))

  When trying to create a discussion using the top left sidebar modal with an role that don't have the `view-other-user-channels ` permission, an empty list would be shown, which is a wrong behavior.

### 🎉 New features


- Add `teams.convertToChannel` endpoint ([#22188](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/22188))

  - Add new `teams.converToChannel` endpoint;  
  - Update `ConvertToTeam` modal text (since this action can now be reversed);  
  - Remove corresponding team memberships when a team is deleted or converted to a channel;

- Add setting to configure default role for user on manual registration ([#20650](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/20650) by [@lucassartor](https://github.com/lucassartor))

  Add an `admin` setting to determine the initial `role` for new users who registered manually (through the register form and via API, not using an authentication service), normally all new users are assigned to the `user` role.

  The setting can be found in `Admin`->`Accounts`->`Registration`.

  The setting initial value is false, so the default behaviour stays the same while creating a new server or upgrading one.

  Video showing an example of the setting being used and creating an new user with the default roles via API.

- Content-Security-Policy for inline scripts ([#20724](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/20724))

  Security policies were applied for inline scripts cases. Due to the libraries and components we use it is not possible to disable inline styles and images as they would break Oembeds and other libraries.


  basically the inline scripts were moved to a js file

  and besides that some suggars syntax like `addScript` and `addStyle` were added, this way the application already takes care of inserting the elements and providing the content automatically.

- Open modals in side effects outside React ([#22247](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/22247))

- Remove "Game Center" setting ([#22232](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/22232) by [@lolimay](https://github.com/lolimay))

### 🚀 Improvements


- **APPS:** Refactor bridges ([#21253](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/21253))

  Make the bridge classes extend abstract classes provided by the engine instead of just implementing an interface. The new abstract classes feature proxy methods used for permission verification in each method. This is also offers space to add more behaviors before executing the actual bridge methods.

- Add BBB and Jitsi to Team ([#22312](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/22312))

  Added 2 new settings:  
  - `Admin > Video Conference > Big Blue Button > Enable for teams`  
  - `Admin > Video Conference > Jitsi > Enable in teams`

- Add debouncing to units selects filters ([#22097](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/22097))

- Add modal to close chats when tags/comments are not required ([#22245](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/22245) by [@rafaelblink](https://github.com/rafaelblink))

  When neither tags or comments are required to close a livechat, show this modal instead:

- Missing tests to `fname` and `prid` in the `rooms.createDiscussion` endpoint ([#22223](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/22223))

  - Add tests to the values of `fname` and `prid` in the `rooms.createDiscussion` endpoint's results.

- New indexes for Omnichannel-related collections ([#22367](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/22367))

- Paginated department select on forward chat ([#22123](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/22123))

  Changes the department dropdown to use the new paginated selects, allowing for searching and displaying more than 50 departments

- Paginated multiselect for EE tags ([#22315](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/22315) by [@rafaelblink](https://github.com/rafaelblink))

  This uses the paginated multiselect for the EE tags selection, allowing more than 50 tags to be shown.

- Remove differentiation between public x private channels in sidebar ([#22160](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/22160))

- Rewrite Create Discussion Modal (only through sidebar) ([#22224](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/22224))

  This is only available by creating a new discussion when clicking on the sidebar button. Other places will be implemented afterwards.

- Send only relevant data via WebSocket ([#22258](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/22258))

  Previously when any data changed on subscriptions or rooms we were getting fresh data from database, to also remove undesired fields, but sometimes the data that changed was not relevant so we were sending the whole object everytime **without** the fields that actually changed. This change aims to reduce this overhead and also send less data to clients.

### 🐛 Bug fixes


- _updatedAt attribute not being automatically updated by raw models ([#22306](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/22306))

- **EE:** Canned responses can't be deleted ([#22095](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/22095) by [@rafaelblink](https://github.com/rafaelblink))

  Deletion button has been removed from the edition option.

  Fix omnichannel monitor permissions being added back to omnichannel monitor role on every startup.

- **ENTERPRISE:** Prevent Visitor Abandonment after forwarding chat ([#22243](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/22243))

  Currently the Visitor Abandonment timer isn't affected when the chat is forwarded. However this is affecting the UX in certain situations like eg: A bot forwarding a chat to an human agent
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34130764/120896383-e4925780-c63e-11eb-937e-ffd7c4836159.png)

  To solve this issue, we'll now be stoping the Visitor Abandonment timer once a chat is forwarded.

- **IMPROVE:** Prevent creation of duplicated roles and new `roles.update` endpoint ([#22279](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/22279) by [@lucassartor](https://github.com/lucassartor))

  Currently, the action of updating a role is broken: because roles have their `_id` = `name`, when updating a role there's no way to validate if the user is trying to update or create a new role with a name that already exists   -  which causes wrong behaviors, such as roles with the same name and not being able to update them.

  To proper fix this, this PR looks to change the creation of roles. Now, roles have a unique  `_id` value and there's a endpoint to update roles: `/api/v1/roles.update`.

  Doing so, it's possible to validate on both endpoints (`roles.create` and `roles.update`) to not allow roles with duplicated names.

  **OBS:** The unique id changes only reflect new roles, the standard roles (such as admin and user) still have `_id` = `name`, but new roles now **can't** have the same name as them.

- `channels.history`, `groups.history` and `im.history` REST endpoints not respecting hide system message config ([#22364](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/22364))

- Apps not syncing status correctly on HA setups ([#22415](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/22415))

  FIxes erros where, on HA setups, instances that DID NOT originate the action of uninstalling and updating an app would maintain the wrong status of apps when they received the notification of these events via Streamer.

- Attachments and avatars not rendered if deployed on subfolder ([#22290](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/22290))

- Auditing page not printing all messages ([#22272](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/22272))

  Changed CSS so printed media from the auditing page includes all page content.

- Memory leak generated by Stream Cast usage ([#22329](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/22329))

  Stream Cast uses a different approach to broadcast data to the instances, it uses the DDP subscription method that requires a collection on the other side, if no collection exists with the given name `broadcast-stream` it caches in memory waiting for the collection to be set later. The cache is cleared only when a reconnection happens.

  This PR overrides the function that processes the data for that specific connection, preventing the cache and everything else to be processed since we already have our low-level listener to process the data.

- Chore: Enable push gateway only if the server is registered ([#22346](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/22346) by [@lucassartor](https://github.com/lucassartor))

  Currently, when creating an unregistered server, the default value of the push gateway setting is set to true and is disabled (it can't be changed unless the server is registered). This is a wrong behavior as an unregistered server **can't** use the push gateway.

  This PR creates a validation to check if the server is registered when enabling the push gateway. That way, even if the push gateway setting is turned on, but the server is unregistered, the push gateway **won't** work   - it will behave like it is off.

- **APPS:** Ability for Rocket.Chat Apps to delete rooms ([#21875](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/21875) by [@lucassartor](https://github.com/lucassartor))

  Adds a new `delete` method on the rooms bridge in order to trigger the deletion of rooms via the Apps-Engine.

- **ENTERPRISE:** Introduce Load Rotation routing algorithm for Omnichannel ([#22090](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/22090) by [@rafaelblink](https://github.com/rafaelblink))

  This PR introduces a new Auto Chat Distribution (ACD) algorithm for Omnichannel: **Load Rotation**.
  The algorithm distributes chats to agents one by one, which means that when a new chat arrives, the agent with the oldest routing assignment time will be selected to serve the chat, regardless of the number of chats in progress each agent has.

- New Message Parser ([#21962](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/21962))

  The objective is to put an end to the confusion that we face having multiple parsers, and the problems that this brings, it is still experimental then users need to choose to use it.

  The benefits are multiple. no more unexpected cases or grammatical collisions (in addition to more flexible nested cases like bold within link labels).
  Besides, we no longer render raw html, instead we use components, so the xss attacks are over (the easy ones at least). Without further discoveries and at the fronted, we only reder what is delivered thus improving our performance.
  This can be used in multiple places, (message, alert, sidenav and in the entire mobile application.)

- Option to notify failed login attempts to a channel ([#21968](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/21968))

- Option to prevent users from using Invisible status ([#20084](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/20084) by [@lucassartor](https://github.com/lucassartor))

  Add an `admin` option to allow/disallow the `Invisible` status option from all users. This option is available in the `Accounts` section.

  If the option is turned off, the `users.setStatus` endpoint is also restricted from users trying to change their status to `Invisible`, throwing the following error:
  ```json
  {
    "success": false,
    "error": "Invisible status is disabled [error-not-allowed]",

- CAS popup login size input type ([#21907](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/21907) by [@Deepak-learner](https://github.com/Deepak-learner))

- Inconsistent and misleading 2FA settings ([#22042](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/22042) by [@lucassartor](https://github.com/lucassartor))

  Currently, there are some inconsistencies and incorrect behaviors on the 2FA settings, such as:
  
  - When disabling the TOTP 2FA, all 2FA are disabled;  
  - There are no option to disable only the TOTP 2FA;  
  - If 2FA are disabled, the other settings aren't blocked (the e-mail 2FA setting, for example);  
  - It lacks some labels to warn the user of some specific 2FA options.

  This PR looks to fix those issues.

### 🐛 Bug fixes


- **APPS:** Scheduler duplicating recurrent tasks after server restart ([#21866](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/21866))

  Reintroduces the old method for creating recurring tasks in the apps' scheduler bridge to ensure tasks won't be duplicated.

  By introducing the [`skipImmediate` property option](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/21353)  at the [`scheduleRecurring`](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/blob/f8171f464ed8a7487795651767695fb33a1c709e/app/apps/server/bridges/scheduler.js#L119) method, the `every` method from _agenda.js_, which ensured no duplicates were created, was removed in favor of a more manual procedure. The new procedure was not taking into account the management of duplicates and as a result multiple copies of the same task could be created and they would get executed at the same time.

  In the case of server restarts, every time this event happened and the app had the `startupSetting` configured to use _recurring tasks_, they would get recreated the same number of times. In the case of a server that restarts frequently (_n_ times), there would be the same (_n_) number of tasks duplicated (and running) in the system.

- **ENTERPRISE:** Omnichannel Monitors can't forward chats to departments that they are not supervising ([#22128](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/22128))

  Currently, Omnichannel Monitors just can't forward chats to a department that is part of a `Business Unit` they're not supervising. This issue is causing critical problems on customer operations since this behaviour is not by design.
  The reason this issue is taking place is that, by design, Monitors just have access to departments related to the `Business Units` they're monitoring, but this restriction is designed only for Omnichannel management areas, which means in case the monitor is, also, an agent, they're supposed to be able to forward a chat to any available departments regardless the `Business Units` it's associated with.
  So, initially, the restriction was implemented on the `Department Model` and, now, we're implementing the logic properly and introducing a new parameter to department endpoints, so the client will define which type of departments it needs.

- **ENTERPRISE:** Omnichannel Monitors can't forward chats to departments that they are not supervising ([#22142](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/22142))

- Adding Custom Fields to show on user info check ([#20955](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/20955))

  The setting custom fields to show under user info was not being used when rendering fields in user info. This pr adds those checks and only renders the fields mentioned under in admin -> accounts -> Custom Fields to Show in User Info.

- Adding permission 'add-team-channel' for Team Channels Contextual bar ([#21591](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/21591))

  Added 'add-team-channel' permission to the 2 buttons in team channels contextual bar, for adding channels to teams.

- Adding retentionEnabledDefault check before showing warning message  ([#20692](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/20692))

  Added check for retentionEnabledDefault before showing prune warning message.

- App crashes when downloads come from WebDAV and the server is not available ([#21985](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/21985))

- App license error detail message removed ([#22091](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/22091))

  Banner in the App Detail page that showed a message explaining why the license validation had failed was removed previously, likely during the React rewrite.

  Before, when you look at the members of a room in which you are not a member the app crashed, i corrected this problem.
  Indeed, there was a check on each currentSubscription.<somehting> to see if it was not undefined except on currentSubscription.blocker

- Fixing Jitsi call ended Issue. ([#21808](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/21808))

  The new rewrite in react of contextual call component broke the Jitsi "click to join" messages. The issue being after 10 seconds of initiating the call, the message "click to join" always returned "Call Ended" even if the call was still going on.
  This was due to the fact that after closing the contextual bar, the react component gets unmounted and we are not able to keep track of ongoing call and increase jitsi room timeout. 

  This PR solves this issue by using the setInterval methods on component will unmount. When the call component unmounts, we keep on checking the state of jitsi call and based on conditions increase the jitsi room timeout. After the call is ended all setInterval calls are closed.

  This PR also removes the implementation of HEARTBEAT events of JitsiBridge. This is because this is no longer needed and all logic is being taken care of by the unmount function.

- Incorrect error message when opening channel in anonymous read ([#22066](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/22066) by [@lucassartor](https://github.com/lucassartor))

  Every time you open a public channel with threads in it when using anonymous read an `Incorrect User` error will be thrown. 
  This is an incorrect behaviour as everything that is public should be valid for an anonymous user.

  Some files are adapted to that and have already removed this kind of incorrect error, but there are some that need some fix, this PR aims to do that.

- Make the FR translation consistent with the 'room' translation + typos ([#21913](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/21913) by [@Jeanstaquet](https://github.com/Jeanstaquet))

  In the FR translation files, there were two terms that were used to refer to **'room'**:  
  - 'salon' (149 times used)

  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45966964/116829860-ac62a980-aba6-11eb-8212-e6f15ed0af82.png)
  
  - 'salle' (46 times used)

  The problem is that both were used in the same context and sometimes even in the same option list. 
  However, since 'salon' is a better translation and was also in the majority, I used the translation 'salon' wherever 'salle' was marked.  

  For example:

  When you are in the admin and want to change a room 'd' setting, it doesn't work because it takes into account the name that is set automatically and therefore tries to save that name. Since the name is not valid and should not be registered, we cannot change the setting for the 'd' room. 
  I made sure that when you want to change a setting in a 'd' room, that you don't take the name into account

  If a user does not have an email address, they cannot change it via their profile or via the admin. I fixed this issue.

  It allows for update of apps using a zip file.

  When installing apps using the zip file, either by url or the file form, if the app was already installed, an error would be thrown stating the condition and forbidding the installation. Now, when sending a zip file of an app that is already installed, the user is presented with the following modal:

  If the app also requires permissions to be reviewed, the modal that handles permission reviews will be shown after this one is accepted.

  Create a new permission: `message-impersonate`. For new installs only bot role will have the permission and for updating installs the permission will also be given to user role, so it won't break running deployments.

  If a message is being sent with `avatar` or `alias` properties, it validates if the sender has the `message-impersonate` permission, if not, an error is throwed:
  ```json
  {
    "success": false,
    "error": "Not enough permission",
    "stack": "Error: Not enough permission\n ..."
  }

- Visibility of burger menu on certain width ([#20736](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/20736))

  Burger was not visible on a certain width, specifically between 600 to   780. if width is more than 780px sidebar is shown, if less than 600 then burger icon was shown. But it wasn't shown between 600px to 780 px.
  It was because for showing burger icon we were only checking for `isMobile` which is lenght only less than   600. So i added one more check for condition if length is less than 780 px.

`2021-06-06  ·  1 🚀  ·  1 🐛  ·  1 👩‍💻👨‍💻`

- Node: `12.22.1`
- NPM: `6.14.1`
- MongoDB: `3.4, 3.6, 4.0`
- Apps-Engine: `1.25.0`

### 🚀 Improvements


- Send only relevant data via WebSocket ([#22258](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/22258))

  Previously when any data changed on subscriptions or rooms we were getting fresh data from database, to also remove undesired fields, but sometimes the data that changed was not relevant so we were sending the whole object everytime **without** the fields that actually changed. This change aims to reduce this overhead and also send less data to clients.

### 🐛 Bug fixes


- Support DISABLE_PRESENCE_MONITOR env var in new DB watchers ([#22257](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/22257))

### 🎉 New features


- **APPS:** Method to fetch Livechat Departments ([#21690](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/21690))

  New method in the livechat bridge that allows apps to fetch departments that are enabled and have agents assigned

- **APPS:** onInstall and onUninstall events ([#21565](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/21565) by [@lucassartor](https://github.com/lucassartor))

  Adding the `user` information when installing and uninstalling an App to the Apps-Engine.

- **ENTERPRISE:** LDAP Teams Sync ([#21658](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/21658))

- **Enterprise:** Second layer encryption for data transport (alpha) ([#21692](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/21692))

  The second layer encryption for data transport works implementing the ECDH algorithm where session keys are exchanged before the rest of the communication. This feature is **enterprise only** since it requires the micro-services architecture and it's in the early stage of tests as an **alpha** feature and documentation may not be available before the beta stage.

- New set of rules for client code ([#21318](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/21318))

  This _small_ PR does the following:
  
  - Now **React** is the web client's first-class citizen, being **loaded before Blaze**. Thus, `BlazeLayout` calls render templates inside of a React component (`BlazeLayoutWrapper`);  
  - Main client startup code, including polyfills, is written in **TypeScript**;  
  - At the moment, routes are treated as regular startup code; it's expected that `FlowRouter` will be deprecated in favor of a new routing library;  
  - **React** was updated to major version **17**, deprecating the usage of `React` as namespace (e.g. use `memo()` instead of `React.memo()`);  
  - The `client/` and `ee/client/` directory are linted with a **custom ESLint configuration** that includes:
    - **Prettier**;
    - `react-hooks/*` rules for TypeScript files;
    - `react/no-multi-comp`, enforcing the rule of **one single React component per module**;
    - `react/display-name`, which enforces that **React components must have a name for debugging**;
    - `import/named`, avoiding broken named imports.  
  - A bunch of components were refactored to match the new ESLint rules.

- On Hold system messages ([#21360](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/21360) by [@rafaelblink](https://github.com/rafaelblink))

  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34130764/115442079-3a49a680-a22f-11eb-9ee8-6c705097cd57.png)

- Password history ([#21607](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/21607))

  - Store each user's previously used passwords in a `passwordHistory` field (in the `users` record);  
  - Users' previously used passwords are stored in their `passwordHistory` even when the setting is disabled;  
  - Add "Password History" setting -- when enabled, it blocks users from reusing their most recent passwords;  
  - Convert `comparePassword` file to TypeScript.

  ![Password_Change](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36537004/115035168-ac726200-9ea2-11eb-93c6-fc8182ba5f3f.png)

  add teams.update endpoint

- Standard Importer Structure ([#18357](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/18357))

### 🚀 Improvements


- **APPS:** Scheduler option to skip immediate execution of recurring jobs ([#21353](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/21353) by [@lolimay](https://github.com/lolimay))

  Create and schedule a task manually at `scheduleRecurring` method so the first iteration runs after the configured interval. This is accomplished by adding the setting `skipImmediate: true` when setting up the task.

- Add error messages to the creation of channels or usernames containing reserved words ([#21016](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/21016))

  Display error messages when the user attempts to create or edit users' or channels' names with any of the following words (**case-insensitive**):  
  - admin;  
  - administrator;  
  - system;  
  - user.
  ![create-channel](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36537004/110132223-b421ef80-7da9-11eb-82bc-f0d4e1df967f.png)

- add permission check when adding a channel to a team ([#21689](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/21689) by [@g-thome](https://github.com/g-thome))

  add permission check for each room

- Add proxy for data export ([#20998](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/20998))

  Add a proxy for data export downloads (instead of just linking ufs urls) so we can have more control over its response. Also added a human readable message when the user tries to download the user-data unauthenticated.

- Add support to range downloads on file system storage ([#21463](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/21463))

- Alert on team deletion ([#21617](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/21617))

- Do not require pre-configured tags in Omnichannel chats ([#21488](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/21488) by [@rafaelblink](https://github.com/rafaelblink))

- OEmbed details by requesting using the accept language header on the request ([#21686](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/21686))

  - Send `Accept-Language` header on oembed requests

- Resize custom emojis on upload instead of saving at max res ([#21593](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/21593))

  - Create new MediaService (ideally, should be in charge of all media-related operations)  
  - Resize emojis to 128x128

### 🐛 Bug fixes


- **Enterprise:** Omnichannel simultaneous chat limit is not properly checking the limit by department ([#21839](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/21839))

  The Omnichannel Concurrent Chat Limit feature is not working properly when checking the limit per department, the reason is that the algorithm that fetches the number of ongoing chats per agent wasn't considering the department of the subscriptions, hence,  the number returned from DB was bigger than it should be.

- Add tag input to Closing Chat modal ([#21462](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/21462) by [@rafaelblink](https://github.com/rafaelblink))

- Allows more than 25 discussions/files to be loaded in the contextualbar ([#21511](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/21511) by [@Jeanstaquet](https://github.com/Jeanstaquet))

  In some places, you could not load more than 25 threads/discussions/files on the screen when searching the lists in the contextualbar.
  Threads & list are numbered for a better view of the solution

- Allows to display more than 25 users maximum in the users list ([#21518](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/21518) by [@Jeanstaquet](https://github.com/Jeanstaquet))

  Now when you scroll to the bottom of the users list, it shows more users. Before the fix, the limit for the query for loadMore was calculated so that no additional users could be loaded.

  That way it can communicate with the Apps-Engine by the `IPreRoomUserLeave` and `IPostRoomUserLeave` event interfaces.

- **Enterprise:** Omnichannel On-Hold Queue ([#20945](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/20945))

  ### About this feature
  This feature has been introduced to deal with Inactive chats. A chat is considered Inactive if an Omnichannel End User (aka Visitor) has not replied back to an agent in some time. These types of inactive chats become very important when an organisation has a limit set for `Max Simultaneous Chats per agent` which is defined by the following setting :point_down:  , as more number of Inactive chats would directly affect an agent's productivity.
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34130764/111533003-4d7ad980-878c-11eb-8c1c-2796678a07db.png)

  Before this feature, we only had one option to deal with such Inactive/Abandoned chats   - which was to auto close abandoned chats via this setting :point_down: 
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34130764/111534353-e65e2480-878d-11eb-82a5-71368064ef45.png)

  however closing a chat isn't a best option for some cases. Let me take an example to explain a scenario

  > An agent is assisting a customer for installing a very huge software which is likely to take more than 20-30 minutes to download. In such scenarios closing a chat isn't the best approach since even after the lengthy download the customer might still need some assist from the agent.
  > So basically this chat is going to block the agent's queue until the customer is able to finish his time-consuming download task in which he/she doesn't require any agent's assistance. Due to the `Max Simultaneous Chats per agent` limit, the agent is also not able to use this extra time to help other customer thus affecting his overall productivity.

  **So how does the On-Hold feature solve this problem?**
  With the On-Hold feature, an agent is now able to place a chat on-hold. On-Hold chats **don’t count towards the maximum number of concurrent chats** an agent can have. So in our above example, the agent can simply now place the customer on-hold for 20-30 minutes until the customer downloads the software and within this time, the agent can serve other customers   - hence increasing the productivity of an agent.

  ----------------------------------------
  ### Working of the new On-Hold feature

  #### How can you place a chat on Hold ?

  A chat can be placed on-hold via 2 means  
  1. Automatically place Abandoned chats On-hold
      ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34130764/111537074-06431780-8791-11eb-8d23-99f5d9f8ec45.png)
    Via this :top: option you can define a timer which will get started when a customer sends a message. If we don't receive any message from the customer within this timer, the timer will get expired and the chat will be considered as Abandoned. 
      ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34130764/111537346-53bf8480-8791-11eb-8dc7-260633b4e98f.png)
    The via this :top:  setting you can choose to automatically place this abandoned chat On Hold  
  2.  Manually place a chat On Hold 
      As an admin, you can allow an agent to manually place a chat on-hold. To do so, you'll need to turn on this :point_down: setting
      ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34130764/111537545-97b28980-8791-11eb-86fd-db45b87e9cc1.png)
      Now an agent will be able to see a new `On Hold` button within their `Visitor Info Panel` like this :point_down: , provided the agent has sent the last message
      ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34130764/111537853-f24be580-8791-11eb-9561-d77ba430c625.png)

  #### How can you resume a On Hold chat ?
  An On Hold chat can be resumed via 2 means
  
  1. If the Customer sends a message
     If the Customer / Omnichannel End User sends a message to the On Hold chat, the On Hold chat will get automatically resumed.  
  2. Manually by agent
    An Agent can manually resume the On Hold chat via clicking the `Resume` button in the bottom of a chat room. 
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34130764/111538666-f88e9180-8792-11eb-8d14-01453b8e3db0.png)

  #### What would happen if the agent already reached maximum chats, and a On-Hold chat gets resumed ?
  Based on how the chat was resumed, there are multiple cases are each case is dealt differently
  
  - If an agent manually tries to resume the On Hold chat, he/she will get an error saying  `Maximum Simultaneous chat limit reached`  
  - If a customer replies back on an On Hold chat and the last serving agent has reached maximum capacity, then this customer will be placed on the queue again from where based on the Routing Algorithm selected, the chat will get transferred to any available agent

  ## Teams



  You can easily group your users as Teams on Rocket.Chat. The feature takes the hassle out of managing multiple users one by one and allows you to handle them at the same time efficiently.

  
  - Teams can be public or private and each team can have its own channels, which also can be public or private.  
  - It's possible to add existing channels to a Team or create new ones inside a Team.  
  - It's possible to invite people outside a Team to join Team's channels.  
  - It's possible to convert channels to Teams  
  - It's possible to add all team members to a channel at once  
  - Team members have roles


  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70927132/113421955-4f56b680-93a2-11eb-80dc-9b70a3f09b3e.png)



  **Quickly onboard new users with Autojoin channels**

  Teams can have Auto-join channels –  channels to which the team members are automatically added, so you don’t need to go through the manual process of adding users repetitively

  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70927132/113419284-81194e80-939d-11eb-9fff-aeb05cbc8089.png)

  **Instantly mention multiple members at once** (available in EE)

  With Teams, you don’t need to remember everyone’s name to communicate with a team quickly. Just mention a Team — @engineers, for instance —  and all members will be instantly notified.

- Apps-Engine: `1.23.0`

### 🚀 Improvements


- Close Call contextual bar after starting jitsi call. ([#21004](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/21004))

  After jitsi call is started, if the call is started in a new window then we should close contextual tab bar.
  So, when 'YES' is pressed on modal, we call handleClose function if openNewWindow is true, as call doesn't starts on tab bar, it starts on new window.

### 🐛 Bug fixes


- Missing spaces on attachment  ([#21020](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/21020))

- Stopping Jitsi reload ([#20973](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/20973))

  The Function where Jitsi call is started gets called many times due to `room.usernames` dep of useMemo, this dep triggers reloading of this function many times.
  So removing this dep from useMemo dependencies

- Add tooltips to Thread header buttons ([#20456](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/20456) by [@aKn1ghtOut](https://github.com/aKn1ghtOut))

- Admin cannot clear user details like bio or nickname ([#20785](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/20785))

  When the API users.update is called to update user data, it passes data to saveUser function. Here before saving data like bio or nickname we are checking if they are available or not. If data is available then we are saving it, but we are not doing anything when data isn't available.

  So unsetting data if data isn't available to save. Will also fix bio and other fields. :)

- Remove duplicate getCommonRoomEvents() event binding for starredMessages ([#20185](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/20185) by [@aKn1ghtOut](https://github.com/aKn1ghtOut))

  I removed the top events call that only bound the getCommonRoomEvents(). Therefore, only one call for the same is left, which is at the end of the file. Having the events bound just once removes the bugs mentioned.

- Unset tshow on deleted messages ([#20444](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/20444) by [@aKn1ghtOut](https://github.com/aKn1ghtOut))

  When setting 'Message_ShowDeletedStatus' is set to true, deleting a message with `tshow: true` causes a bug on the frontend. This issue should, however, never be logically possible as a 'removed' message should not have tshow anyway. Hence, this PR unsets that when the message is set to "Message Removed".

  Also, bot users having status as online were classified as offline, with this change they are now correctly classified based on their corresponding statuses.

### 🎉 New features


- **Apps:** Apps Permission System ([#20078](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/20078))

- **Apps:** IPreFileUpload event ([#20285](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/20285) by [@lolimay](https://github.com/lolimay))

- **ENTERPRISE:** Automatic transfer of unanswered conversations to another agent ([#20090](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/20090))

- **ENTERPRISE:** Omnichannel Contact Manager as preferred agent for routing ([#20244](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/20244))

  If the `Contact-Manager` is assigned to a Visitor, the chat will automatically get transferred to the respective Contact-Manager, provided the Contact-Manager is online. In-case the Contact-Manager is offline, the chat will be transferred to any other online agent.
  We have provided a setting to control this auto-assignment feature
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34130764/104880961-8104d780-5986-11eb-9d87-82b99814b028.png)

  Behavior based-on Routing method
  
  1. Auto-selection, Load-Balancing, or External Service (`autoAssignAgent = true`)
    This is straightforward, 
        - if the Contact-manager is online, the chat will be transferred to the Contact-Manger only
        - if the Contact-manager is offline, the chat will be transferred to any other online-agent based on the Routing system  
  2. Manual-selection (`autoAssignAgent = false`)
        - If the Contact-Manager is online, the chat will appear in the Queue of Contact-Manager **ONLY**
        - If the Contact-Manager is offline, the chat will appear in the Queue of all related Agents/Manager ( like it's done right now )

- Banner system and NPS ([#20221](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/20221))

  More robust and scalable banner system for alerting users.

- Email Inboxes for Omnichannel ([#20101](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/20101) by [@rafaelblink](https://github.com/rafaelblink))

  With this new feature, email accounts will receive email messages(threads) which will be transformed into Omnichannel chats. It'll be possible to set up multiple email accounts, test the connection with email server(email provider) and define the behaviour of each account.

- Server Info page ([#19517](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/19517))

### 🚀 Improvements


- Add extra SAML settings to update room subs and add private room subs. ([#19489](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/19489) by [@tlskinneriv](https://github.com/tlskinneriv))

  Added a SAML setting to support updating room subscriptions each time a user logs in via SAML.
  Added a SAML setting to support including private rooms in SAML updated subscriptions (whether initial or on each logon).

- Autofocus on directory ([#20509](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/20509))

- Don't use global search by default ([#19777](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/19777) by [@i-kychukov](https://github.com/i-kychukov) & [@ikyuchukov](https://github.com/ikyuchukov))

  Global chat search is not set by default now.

- Message Collection Hooks ([#20121](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/20121))

  Integrating a list of messages into a React component imposes some challenges. Its content is provided by some REST API calls and live-updated by streamer events. To avoid too much coupling with React Hooks, the structures `RecordList`, `MessageList` and their derivatives are simple event emitters created and connected on components via some simple hooks, like `useThreadsList()` and `useRecordList()`.

- Rewrite Announcement as React component ([#20172](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/20172))

- Rewrite Prune Messages as React component ([#19900](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/19900))

- Rewrite User Dropdown and Kebab menu. ([#20070](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/20070))

  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40830821/103699786-3a74ad80-4f82-11eb-913e-2e09d5f7eac6.png)

- Title for user avatar buttons ([#20083](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/20083) by [@sushant52](https://github.com/sushant52))

  Made user avatar change buttons to be descriptive of what they do.

- Tooltip added for Kebab menu on chat header ([#20116](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/20116))

  Added the missing Tooltip for kebab menu on chat header.
  ![tooltip after](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58601732/104031406-b07f4b80-51f2-11eb-87a4-1e8da78a254f.gif)

### 🐛 Bug fixes

  Users can be removed from channels without any error message.

- Added context check for closing active tabbar for member-list ([#20228](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/20228))

  When we click on a username and then click on see user's full profile, a tab gets active and shows us the user's profile, the problem occurs when the tab is still active and we try to see another user's profile. In this case, tabbar gets closed.
  To resolve this, added context check for closing action of active tabbar.

- Added Margin between status bullet and status label ([#20199](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/20199))

  Added Margins between status bullet and status label

- Added success message on saving notification preference. ([#20220](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/20220) by [@Darshilp326](https://github.com/Darshilp326))

- Changed success message for ignoring member. ([#19996](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/19996) by [@Darshilp326](https://github.com/Darshilp326))

- Fix error that occurs on changing archive status of room ([#20098](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/20098) by [@aKn1ghtOut](https://github.com/aKn1ghtOut))

  This PR fixes an issue that happens when you try to edit the info of a room, and save changes after changing the value of "Archived". The archive functionality is handled separately from other room settings. The archived key is not used in the saveRoomSettings method but was still being sent over. Hence, the request was being considered invalid. I deleted the "archived" key from the data being sent in the request, making the request valid again.

- Livechat.RegisterGuest method removing unset fields ([#20124](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/20124) by [@rafaelblink](https://github.com/rafaelblink))

  After changes made on https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/19931, the `Livechat.RegisterGuest` method started removing properties from the visitor inappropriately. The properties that did not receive value were removed from the object.
  Those changes were made to support the new Contact Form, but now the form has its own method to deal with Contact data so those changes are no longer necessary.

- Markdown added for Header Room topic ([#20021](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/20021))

  With the new 3.10.0 version update the Links in topic section below room name were not working, for more info refer issue #20018

- Remove duplicate blaze events call for EmojiActions from roomOld ([#20159](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/20159) by [@aKn1ghtOut](https://github.com/aKn1ghtOut))

  A few methods concerning Emojis are bound multiple times to the DOM using the Template events() call, once in the reactions init.js and the other time after they get exported from app/ui/client/views/app/lib/getCommonRoomEvents.js to whatever page binds all the functions. The getCommonRoomEvents methods are always bound, hence negating a need to bind in a lower-level component.

- Room special name in prompts ([#20277](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/20277) by [@aKn1ghtOut](https://github.com/aKn1ghtOut))

  The "Hide room" and "Leave Room" confirmation prompts use the "name" key from the room info. When the setting "
  Allow Special Characters in Room Names" is enabled, the prompts show the normalized names instead of those that contain the special characters.

  Changed the value being used from name to fname, which always has the user-set name.

- Performance issues when using new Oplog implementation ([#19181](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/19181))

  A missing configuration was not limiting the new oplog tailing to pool the database frequently even when no data was available, leading to both node and mongodb process been consuming high CPU even with low usage. This case was happening for installations using `mmapv1` database engine or when no admin access was granted to the database user, both preventing the usage of the new [Change Streams](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/changeStreams/) implementation and fallbacking to our custom oplog implementation in replacement to the Meteor's one what was able to be disabled and use the native implementation via the environmental variable `USE_NATIVE_OPLOG=true`.

# 3.3.0
`2020-05-27  ·  20 🎉  ·  8 🚀  ·  41 🐛  ·  45 🔍  ·  37 👩‍💻👨‍💻`

### Engine versions
- Node: `12.16.1`
- NPM: `6.14.0`
- MongoDB: `3.4, 3.6, 4.0`

### 🎉 New features


- **APPS-ENGINE:** Essentials mechanism ([#17656](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/17656))

- **Apps-Engine:** New Room events ([#17487](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/17487))

- **ENTERPRISE:** Omnichannel Last-Chatted Agent Preferred option ([#17666](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/17666))

  If activated, this feature will store the last agent that assisted each Omnichannel visitor when a conversation is taken. So, when a visitor returns(it works with any entry point, Livechat, Facebook, REST API, and so on) and starts a new chat, the routing system checks:

  1   - The visitor object for any stored agent that the visitor has previously talked to;
  2   - If a previous agent is not found, the system will try to find a previous conversation of the same visitor. If a room is found, the system will get the previous agent from the room;

  After this process, if an agent has been found, the system will check the agent's availability to assist the new chat. If it's not available, then the routing system will get the next available agent in the queue.

- **ENTERPRISE:** Support for custom Livechat registration form fields ([#17581](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/17581))

### 🐛 Bug fixes


- Email configs not updating after setting changes ([#17578](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/17578))

- Emoji picker search broken ([#17570](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/17570))

- Error during data export for DMs ([#17577](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/17577) by [@mtmr0x](https://github.com/mtmr0x))

- LDAP login on Enteprise Version ([#17508](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/17508))

- Login Forbidden on servers that had LDAP enabled in the past ([#17579](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/17579))

- Push settings enabled when push gateway is selected ([#17582](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/17582))

- Reactions may present empty names of who reacted when using Real Names ([#17536](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/17536))

  When changing usernames the reactions became outdated since it's not possible to update the usernames stored there, so when the server users Real Name setting enabled the system process all messages before return to the clients and get the names of the usernames to show since the usernames are outdated the names will not be found. Now the usernames will be displayed when the name can't be found as a temporary fix until we change the architecture of the data to fix the issue.

`2020-04-27  ·  19 🎉  ·  10 🚀  ·  34 🐛  ·  19 🔍  ·  34 👩‍💻👨‍💻`

### Engine versions
- Node: `12.16.1`
- NPM: `6.13.4`
- MongoDB: `3.4, 3.6, 4.0`

### 🎉 New features


- **ENTERPRISE:** Allows to set a group of departments accepted for forwarding chats ([#17335](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/17335))

- Better Push and Email Notification logic ([#17357](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/17357))

  We are still using the same logic to define which notifications every new message will generate, it takes some servers' settings, users's preferences and subscriptions' settings in consideration to determine who will receive each notification type (desktop, audio, email and mobile push), but now it doesn't check the user's status (online, away, offline) for email and mobile push notifications but send those notifications to a new queue with the following rules:
  
  - When the user is online the notification is scheduled to be sent in 120 seconds  
  - When the user is away the notification is scheduled to be sent in 120 seconds minus the amount of time he is away  
  - When the user is offline the notification is scheduled to be sent right away  
  - When the user reads a channel all the notifications for that user are removed (clear queue)  
  - When a notification is processed to be sent to a user and there are other scheduled notifications:
    - All the scheduled notifications for that user are rescheduled to now
    - The current notification goes back to the queue to be processed ordered by creation date

- Buttons to check/uncheck all users and channels on import ([#17207](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/17207))
