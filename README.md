# 💻 Deploy Rocket.Chat

We support different methods of deployment for different needs. Choose your method:

- Are you deploying Rocket.Chat on your own servers? You can deploy using one of the recommended methods: Docker, Podman, or Kubernetes. Refer to the [Deployment Guide](https://docs.rocket.chat/docs/deploy-rocketchat) for details. Before you deploy, make sure to check the [system requirements](https://docs.rocket.chat/docs/system-requirements) to deploy a workspace successfully. Alternatively, deploy Rocket.Chat using [Launchpad](https://docs.rocket.chat/docs/deploy-with-launchpad) for a quick and straightforward Kubernetes setup where you don't have to manage each dependency.

- Do you need to run the workspace on an isolated network? Set up an [air-gapped workspace](https://docs.rocket.chat/docs/rocketchat-air-gapped-deployment) to use Rocket.Chat without internet access, suitable for high-security or regulated environments.

- Looking for a custom cloud-hosted solution without handling infrastructure? Check out our premium, dedicated [cloud hosting options](https://docs.rocket.chat/docs/rocketchat-cloud-hosting-service-level-agreement-sla) that adapt to your needs.
