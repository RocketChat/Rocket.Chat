As per MongoDB Lifecycle Schedules ([mongodb.com/legal/support-policy/lifecycles](https://www.mongodb.com/legal/support-policy/lifecycles)) we're removing official support to MongoDB version 4.4 that is has reached end of life in February 2024.

We recommend upgrading to at least MongoDB 6.0+, though 5.0 is still a supported version.

Here are official docs on how to upgrade to some of the supported versions:
