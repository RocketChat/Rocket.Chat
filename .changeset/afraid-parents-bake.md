REST endpoint `/v1/users.createToken` is not deprecated anymore. It now requires a `secret` parameter to generate a token for a user. This change is part of the effort to enhance security by ensuring that tokens are generated with an additional layer of validation. The `secret` parameter is validated against a new environment variable `CREATE_TOKENS_FOR_USERS_SECRET`.
