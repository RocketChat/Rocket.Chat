Introduces an internal ServerEndpoints bridge and accessor to call API v1 routes in-memory, enabling Apps Engine to reuse REST endpoints without HTTP and to act as the calling user securely via shortâ€‘lived impersonation tokens, by dispatching through the v1 Hono router and gating usage behind new server-endpoints.call and server-endpoints.impersonate permissions.
