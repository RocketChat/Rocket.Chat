##### Adds `imgAlt`, `imgWidth`, and `imgHeight` props to the `GenericUpsellModal` component.
These new props improve the accessibility of upsell modals by providing alternative text for images (`imgAlt`) and help prevent layout shifts during image loading by allowing fixed dimensions to be specified (`imgWidth` and `imgHeight`).
