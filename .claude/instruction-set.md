## 📂 Project Ideas   

(This list is going through some rapid changes as we work with mentors to fully flesh out the project ideas.)


### 💡 High-Performance Message Parser Rewrite

👥 **Mentor(s):** Matheus Cardoso  
📢 **Communication Channel:** [team channel](https://open.rocket.chat/channel/idea-High-Performance-Message-Parser-Rewrite)

💬 **Description:**
The current Rocket.Chat [message parser](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/tree/develop/packages/message-parser) relies on [PeggyJS](https://github.com/peggyjs/peggy) (formerly [PEG.js](https://github.com/pegjs/pegjs)). While effective, the generated parser creates performance bottlenecks and adds significant bundle size overhead.
The goal of this project is to replace the PeggyJS-generated parser with a highly optimized, hand-written TypeScript implementation (or using a toolkit like [Chevrotain](https://github.com/Chevrotain/chevrotain). The new implementation must produce the exact same Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) structure as the current one but with a focus on **speed**, **type safety**, and **modularity**.

💪 **Desired Skills:**

* TypeScript
* Algorithms & Data Structures (Context-Free Grammars, Recursive Descent)
* Performance Profiling & Benchmarking
* Property-based Testing (e.g., fast-check)

🎯 **Goals/Deliverables:**

* **Core Implementation:** A functional, drop-in replacement parser in pure TypeScript.
* **100% Parity:** Pass all existing unit tests (`message-parser/tests/*.test.ts`) to guarantee backward compatibility.
* **Robustness:** Implement **Fuzz Testing** (property-based testing) to ensure the parser handles edge cases and malformed inputs without crashing.
* **Performance:** Create a benchmark suite demonstrating significant improvements in **ops/sec** and a reduction in **bundle size**.

### 💡 Rocket.Chat Code Analyzer: agentic inference context reduction mechanics 
👥 **Mentor(s):**   William Liu  
📢 **Communication Channel:**  [team channel](https://open.rocket.chat/channel/idea-Rocket-Chat-Code-Analyzer)   

💬 **Description:**  
Most production codebases are stored in huge revision control repositories (similar to Rocket.Chat) and  are often monorepos that combines the source code of a large number of related subprojects.  

When AI agentic tooling is unleashed on these huge code repositories, it quickly reveals the primitive and wasteful (unoptimized) nature of early tools.    Because LLM inferences are being performed inside a loop where the context of the queries are being built; and the context is constantly increasing in size, query after query.    

This means that repositories as large as Rocket.Chat is often out of reach (of the token/AI-inference budget) for many open source developers.  Even though some AI service providers offer per-session caching and compression (llmlinqua and so on), these are O(n) optimizations that have only nominal impact on the overall project/session cost when large repositories are involved.  

This project explores and implements a class of “domain specific context reduction mechanisms” that can  have exponential impact when working with large code repositories.  These scoping mechanisms are specific to (works only with)  the domain of “code analysis/generation”.  

The project’s code will be an extension or fork of `gemini-cli`,  with the context reduction mechanism added.   It will enable users of `gemini-cli`  to work with (analyze, or generate code based on ) the (known to be huge) Rocket.Chat’s monorepo, all within the budget of the “free tier” inference currently offered by Google.       
Ideally, the mechanics should be implemented in a re-usable manner, extending its utility to other large codebases and the contributor can contribute it back upstream to `gemini-cli`. 

💪 **Desired Skills:**   
* A passion for innovations on open source tooling for the age of open source AI  (vibe) coding 
* Experience with modern code generation cli - Claude Code, OpenCode, OpenAI Codex, gemini-cli and so on
* Intimate understanding of how  gemini-cli works  — Familiarity with Rocket.Chat’s codebase in our monorepo
* TypeScript development 
* Coding with `gemini-cli` extension mechanisms 
* Prompt engineering 
* Theoretical understanding of agentic systems and LLM inference 

🎯 **Goals/Deliverables:**   
Tooling that enables open source AI developers to work with huge production code repositories, within industry provider’s free-tier limits; opening access of these great tools to an exponentially larger population of users.

### 💡 OpenClaw Integration for Rocket.Chat

👥 Mentor(s): Jeffrey Yu

📢 Communication Channel: ** [team channel](https://open.rocket.chat/channel/idea-OpenClaw-Integration-for-Rocket-Chat)

💬 Description:  
[OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai/) (previously named **Clawdbot**) is a fast-growing open-source autonomous AI agent. Unlike traditional prompt-response chatbots, OpenClaw focuses on proactive, autonomous task execution — such as managing workflows, triaging inboxes, orchestrating tools, or generating code — by combining LLM reasoning with real tool integrations. This agent-driven paradigm has led to strong adoption in the open-source community.

The essential interaction layer of OpenClaw allows users to control and supervise the agent conversationally through messaging apps. Currently, OpenClaw [supports](https://docs.openclaw.ai/channels/telegram) messaging platforms like Telegram and WhatsApp, while there is a surging [community demand](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/7520) for Rocket.Chat integration.

This project aims to implement Rocket.Chat integration for OpenClaw. This tool will enable users to interact with autonomous AI agents directly from Rocket.Chat DMs and channels.

🛠️ Desired Skills:

- TypeScript / Node.js
- Experience building webhook-based integrations and handling realtime messaging events
- Familiarity with OpenClaw and Rocket.Chat Apps / APIs
- Understanding of authentication and secure token handling

🎯 Goals:

- Support direct messages and slash-command channel conversations for OpenClaw
- Enable secure configuration and authentication flow with role-based access control

⏳ Project Duration: 175 hours

### 💡 Minimal MCP Server Generator for Rocket.Chat

👥 **Mentor(s):**  Hardik Bhatia  
📢 **Communication Channel:** [team channel](https://open.rocket.chat/channel/idea-Minimal-MCP-Server-Generator-for-Rocket-Chat)   

💬 **Description:**
This is an extension/customization of open source `gemini-cli` that will generate a production-ready MCP server, together with tests,  for any subset of Rocket.Chat APIs specified. 

MCP is high level alternative protocol used for LLM function calling (tools calling) that Anthropic had trained their LLM to excel in.  MCP has been adopted on a viral scale by many developers transitioning to AI Code generation.  Most recently, all major frontier models providers/platformers have caught up and supported MCP;  and Anthropic has donated the protocol to the Linux Foundation.    

Today, one major problem when adopting MCP is that it is originally designed to reward the inference platform provider.  Almost all MCP servers are written to support a large set of services APIs that covers the functionality of the specific service provider (usually tightly coupled with an associated platform provider).  And anyone adopting multiple MCP servers will experience “context bloat”  where most of their token budget and context-content is consumed by static MCP requirements; associated with API calls that they will never need or use within their project.  This situation is exacerbated  in agentic code generator workflows where every agent is burning token in loops unnecessarily while supporting API/tools that the project will never need.

Rocket.Chat will solve this problem with this Minimal MCP Server Generator project.  With this tool, Rocket.Chat developers can generate production grade minimal MCP server for their project, covering only the subset of API required by the project.   This will significantly reduce the cost of all Rocket.Chat code generation projects involving MCP.  Since Rocket.Chat is open source, this tool can make many projects possible by fitting into the “free tier” of the platform providers.  

Candidate is encouraged to solve this problem more generically while fulfilling all Rocket.Chat’s requirements.  Ideally, the tool can benefit all similar upstream projects/platforms, open source or otherwise. 

💪 **Desired Skills:**  
* A passion for creating innovative tooling for AI (Vibe 2.0) coding 
* Experience with modern code generation cli : Claude Code, OpenCode, OpenAI Codex, gemini-cli and so on
* Experience with creation  of (or working with) MCP servers
* TypeScript development 
* gemini-cli architecture and extension mechanisms 
* Prompt engineering

🎯 **Goals/Deliverables:**   
A tool to generate a minimal-cover MCP server for anyone developing with Rocket.Chat who also needed MCP support.  This can greatly reduce the cost, while increasing the stability and reliability of agentic code generation process.
