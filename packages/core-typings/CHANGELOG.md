## 7.0.0

### Major Changes

### Minor Changes

- ([#33003](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33003)) Added a new setting to enable/disable file encryption in an end to end encrypted room.

- ([#32868](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32868)) Added `sidepanel` field to `teams.create` and `rooms.saveRoomSettings` endpoints

- ([#33003](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33003)) Fixed a bug related to uploading end to end encrypted file.

  E2EE files and uploads are uploaded as files of mime type `application/octet-stream` as we can't reveal the mime type of actual content since it is encrypted and has to be kept confidential.

  The server resolves the mime type of encrypted file as `application/octet-stream` but it wasn't playing nicely with existing settings related to whitelisted and blacklisted media types.

  E2EE files upload was getting blocked if `application/octet-stream` is not a whitelisted media type.

  Now this PR solves this issue by always accepting E2EE uploads even if `application/octet-stream` is not whitelisted but it will block the upload if `application/octet-stream` is black listed.

### Patch Changes

- ([#32846](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32846)) Fixed issue with system messages being counted as agents' first responses in livechat rooms (which caused the "best first response time" and "average first response time" metrics to be unreliable for all agents)

### Minor Changes

- ([#32224](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32224)) Allow Custom Fields in Messages. API-only feature. It can be enabled and configured in Workspace Settings.

- ([#31976](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31976)) Added support for allowing agents to forward inquiries to departments that may not have any online agents given that `Allow department to receive forwarded inquiries even when there's no available agents` is set to `true` in the department configuration.
  This configuration empowers agents to seamlessly direct incoming requests to the designated department, ensuring efficient handling of queries even when departmental resources are not actively online. When an agent becomes available, any pending inquiries will be automatically routed to them if the routing algorithm supports it.

### Patch Changes

- ([#32374](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32374)) Fixed an issue with some apps that didn't implement executeViewCloseHandler. This causes opened modals to be open forever on UI (unless Esc was clicked). This is because when the UI attempts to close it, it calls the aforementioned handler, and since it didn't exist, apps engine errored out.

  This returned an empty response to the UI, which ignored the response and continued to show the view.

- ([#30478](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/30478)) Added `chat.getURLPreview` endpoint to enable users to retrieve previews for URL (ready to be provided in message send/update)

- ([#31328](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31328)) Fixed an issue caused by the `Fallback Forward Department` feature. Feature could be configured by admins in a way that mimis a loop, causing a chat to be forwarded "infinitely" between those departments. System will now prevent Self & 1-level deep circular references from being saved, and a new setting is added to control the maximum number of hops that the system will do between fallback departments before considering a transfer failure.

## 6.5.3

## 6.5.2

## 6.5.1

### Patch Changes

- c2b224fd82: Exceeding API calls when sending OTR messages

## 6.5.0

### Minor Changes

- c0ef13a0bf: Added `push` statistic, containing three bits. Each bit represents a boolean:
  ```
  1 1 1
  | | |
  | | +- push enabled = 0b1 = 1
  | +--- push gateway enabled = 0b10 = 2
  +----- push gateway changed = 0b100 = 4
  ```
- 92613680b7: Added option to select between two script engine options for the integrations
- ec1b2b9846: Create a deployment fingerprint to identify possible deployment changes caused by database cloning. A question to the admin will confirm if it's a regular deployment change or an intent of a new deployment and correct identification values as needed.
  The fingerprint is composed by `${siteUrl}${dbConnectionString}` and hashed via `sha256` in `base64`.
  An environment variable named `AUTO_ACCEPT_FINGERPRINT`, when set to `true`, can be used to auto-accept an expected fingerprint change as a regular deployment update.
- 5f81a0f3cb: Implemented the License library, it is used to handle the functionality like expiration date, modules, limits, etc.
  Also added a version v3 of the license, which contains an extended list of features.
  v2 is still supported, since we convert it to v3 on the fly.
