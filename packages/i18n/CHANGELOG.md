  E2EE files and uploads are uploaded as files of mime type `application/octet-stream` as we can't reveal the mime type of actual content since it is encrypted and has to be kept confidential.

  The server resolves the mime type of encrypted file as `application/octet-stream` but it wasn't playing nicely with existing settings related to whitelisted and blacklisted media types.

  E2EE files upload was getting blocked if `application/octet-stream` is not a whitelisted media type.

  Now this PR solves this issue by always accepting E2EE uploads even if `application/octet-stream` is not whitelisted but it will block the upload if `application/octet-stream` is black listed.

- ([#31987](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31987)) Implemented a new "Pending Users" tab on the users page to list users who have not yet been activated and/or have not logged in for the first time.
  Additionally, added a "Pending Action" column to aid administrators in identifying necessary actions for each user. Incorporated a "Reason for Joining" field
  into the user info contextual bar, along with a callout for exceeding the seats cap in the users page header. Finally, introduced a new logic to disable user creation buttons upon surpassing the seats cap.
- ([#32548](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32548)) Disable slash commands in encrypted rooms and show a disabled warning.

- ([#32329](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32329)) Added a new setting `Restrict files access to users who can access room` that controls file visibility. This new setting allows users that "can access a room" to also download the files that are there. This is specially important for users with livechat manager or monitor roles, or agents that have special permissions to view closed rooms, since this allows them to download files on the conversation even after the conversation is closed.
  New setting is disabled by default and it is mutually exclusive with the setting `Restrict file access to room members` since this allows _more_ types of users to download files.
