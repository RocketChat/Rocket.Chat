## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- ([#35147](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/35147)) Allows users to filter by multiple departments & by livechat units on `livechat/rooms` endpoint.

- ([#34958](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/34958)) Makes Omnichannel converstion start process transactional.

- ([#33816](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33816) by [@matheusbsilva137](https://github.com/matheusbsilva137)) Replaces Livechat Visitors by Contacts on workspaces' MAC count.
  This allows a more accurate and potentially smaller MAC count in case Contact Identification is enabled, since multiple visitors may be associated to the same contact.
- ([#35208](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/35208)) Adds the Leader group to rooms' members list for better role visibility and consistency.

### Patch Changes

- ([#35029](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/35029)) Fixes a bug that caused routing algorithms to ignore the `Livechat_enabled_when_agent_idle` setting, effectively ignoring idle users from being assigned to inquiries.

## 1.3.1

### Patch Changes

- ([#35112](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/35112) by [@dionisio-bot](https://github.com/dionisio-bot)) Fixes the queue processing of Omnichannel's waiting queue focusing on 3 main areas:
  - Changes the way we fetch the queue list to not append the public queue by default. This makes the server to not run the public queue always (as it is now) even if there was no work to be done.
  - Changes how the queue executes: previously, it was executed in a kind of chain: We fetched a list of "queues", then we took one, processed it, and after that we scheduled the next run, which could take some time. Now, every TIMEOUT, server will try to process all the queues, 1 by 1, and then schedule the next run for all queues after TIMEOUT. This should speed up chat assignment and reduce waiting time when waiting queue is enabled.
  - Removes the unlockAndRequeue and replcaes it with just unlock. This change shouldn't be noticeable. The original idea of the requeueing was to iterate over the inquiries when 1 wasn't being able to be taken. Idea was to avoid blocking the queue by rotating them instead of fetching the same until it gets routed, however this never worked cause we never modified the global sorting for the inquiries and it kept using the ts as the sorting, which returned always the oldest and ignored the requeing. So we're removing those extra steps as well.

- ec1b2b9846: Create a deployment fingerprint to identify possible deployment changes caused by database cloning. A question to the admin will confirm if it's a regular deployment change or an intent of a new deployment and correct identification values as needed.
  The fingerprint is composed by `${siteUrl}${dbConnectionString}` and hashed via `sha256` in `base64`.
  An environment variable named `AUTO_ACCEPT_FINGERPRINT`, when set to `true`, can be used to auto-accept an expected fingerprint change as a regular deployment update.
- 5f81a0f3cb: Implemented the License library, it is used to handle the functionality like expiration date, modules, limits, etc.
  Also added a version v3 of the license, which contains an extended list of features.
  v2 is still supported, since we convert it to v3 on the fly.

### Minor Changes

- ec1b2b9846: Create a deployment fingerprint to identify possible deployment changes caused by database cloning. A question to the admin will confirm if it's a regular deployment change or an intent of a new deployment and correct identification values as needed.
  The fingerprint is composed by `${siteUrl}${dbConnectionString}` and hashed via `sha256` in `base64`.
  An environment variable named `AUTO_ACCEPT_FINGERPRINT`, when set to `true`, can be used to auto-accept an expected fingerprint change as a regular deployment update.
- 5f81a0f3cb: Implemented the License library, it is used to handle the functionality like expiration date, modules, limits, etc.
  Also added a version v3 of the license, which contains an extended list of features.
  v2 is still supported, since we convert it to v3 on the fly.
