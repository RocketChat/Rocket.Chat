# @rocket.chat/meteor

## 7.2.1

### Patch Changes

- Bump @rocket.chat/meteor version.

- Bump @rocket.chat/meteor version.

- ([#34918](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/34918) by [@dionisio-bot](https://github.com/dionisio-bot)) Fixes a behavior when running microservices that caused queue worker to process just the first 60 seconds of request.

  This was due to a mistakenly bound context. Queue Worker was changed to start doing work only after it received the first request.

  However, with the introduction of ASL and actual context on calls, the worker registration was absorbing the context of the call that created them, causing service calls happening inside the callbacks to fail because of a timeout.

- ([#34946](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/34946) by [@dionisio-bot](https://github.com/dionisio-bot)) Fixes SlackBridge service failing to connect to multiple slack workspaces

  - `/v1/livechat/rooms`

  The performance of the endpoint was improved when filtering by:

  - Agent
  - Deparment
  - Open chats

- ([#33474](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33474)) Removes deprecated endpoint `pw.getPolicyReset`. Moving forward, use the `pw.getPolicy` endpoint.

- ([#32162](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32162)) As per MongoDB Lifecycle Schedules ([mongodb.com/legal/support-policy/lifecycles](https://www.mongodb.com/legal/support-policy/lifecycles)) we're removing official support to MongoDB version 4.4 that has reached end of life in February 2024.

  We recommend upgrading to at least MongoDB 6.0+, though 5.0 is still a supported version.

  Here are official docs on how to upgrade to some of the supported versions:

  - [mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/5.0-upgrade-replica-set](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/5.0-upgrade-replica-set/)
  - [mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/6.0-upgrade-replica-set](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/6.0-upgrade-replica-set/)
  - [mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/7.0-upgrade-replica-set](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/7.0-upgrade-replica-set/)

- ([#33333](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33333)) Login services button was not respecting the button color and text color settings. Implemented a fix to respect these settings and change the button colors accordingly.

  Added a warning on all settings which allow admins to change OAuth button colors, so that they can be alerted about WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) compliance.

- ([#32162](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32162)) Added MongoDB 7.0 support

- ([#33449](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33449)) Removes deprecated method `livechat:webhookTest`. Moving forward use the endpoint `livechat/webhook.test`.

- ([#33373](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33373)) This adjustment removes the deprecated method `livechat:searchAgent`. Moving forward, use `livechat/users/agent/:_id` endpoint.

- ([#33442](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33442)) Removes deprecated `livechat:getAnalyticsOverviewData` method. Moving forward use the `livechat/analytics/overview` endpoint.

- ([#32159](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32159)) Api login should not suggest which credential is wrong (password/username)

  Failed login attemps will always return `Unauthorized` instead of the internal fail reason

- ([#31117](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31117)) Adds a new set of permissions to provide a more granular control for the creation and deletion of rooms within teams

  - `create-team-channel`: controls the creations of public rooms within teams, it is checked within the team's main room scope and overrides the global `create-c` permission check. That is, granting this permission to a role allows users to create channels in teams even if they do not have the permission to create channels globally;
  - `create-team-group`: controls the creations of private rooms within teams, it is checked within the team's main room scope and overrides the global `create-p` permission check. That is, granting this permission to a role allows users to create groups in teams even if they do not have the permission to create groups globally;
  - `delete-team-channel`: controls the deletion of public rooms within teams, it is checked within the team's main room scope and complements the global `delete-c` permission check. That is, users must have both permissions (`delete-c` in the channel scope and `delete-team-channel` in its team scope) in order to be able to delete a channel in a team;
  - `delete-team-group`: controls the deletion of private rooms within teams, it is checked within the team's main room scope and complements the global `delete-p` permission check. That is, users must have both permissions (`delete-p` in the group scope and `delete-team-group` in its team scope) in order to be able to delete a group in a team;;

  Renames `add-team-channel` permission (used for adding existing rooms to teams) to `move-room-to-team`, since it is applied to groups and channels.

- ([#33391](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33391)) Removed deprecated method `livechat:loginByToken`. Moving forward, use the endpoint `livechat/visitor/:token`.

- ([#33473](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33473)) Removes deprecated method `getPasswordPolicy`. Moving forward, use the endpoint `pw.getPolicy`.

- ([#31438](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31438)) Upgrades the version of the Meteor framework to 3.0

  The main reason behind this is the upgrade of the Node.js version, where version 14 will be removed and version 20 will be used instead.

  Internally, significant changes have been made, mostly due to the removal of fibers.

  As a result, it was necessary to adapt our code to work with the new version.

  No functionality should have been affected by this, but if you are running Rocket.Chat in unconventional ways, please note that you need to upgrade your Node.js version.

- ([#33426](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33426)) Removed deprecated method `livechat:getNextAgent`. Moving forward, use the `livechat/agent.next/:token` endpoint.

  Removes the Cloud_Workspace_Access_Token & Cloud_Workspace_Access_Token_Expires_At settings since they are not going to be used anymore.
- ([#33423](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33423)) Removed deprecated methods `livechat:removeAgent`, `livechat:removeManager` and `livechat:removeDepartment`. Moving forward, use `livechat/users/agent/:_id`, and `livechat/users/manager/:_id` and `livechat/department/:_id` respectively.`

- ([#33328](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33328)) Allows authorized users to reset the encryption key for end-to-end encrypted rooms. This aims to prevent situations where all users of a room have lost the encryption key, and as such, the access to the room.

- ([#33539](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33539)) Removes deprecated method `livechat:registerAgent`. Moving forward, use the endpoint `livechat/visitor`.

- ([#33520](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33520)) Fixes a behavior of E2EE room creation that allowed any user on the room to define room keys before the room creator, causing race conditions.

- ([#33329](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33329)) Randomizes `e2eKeyId` generation instead of derive it from encoded key. Previously, we used the stringified & encoded version of the key to extract a keyID, however this generated the same keyID for all rooms. As we didn't use this keyID, and rooms didn't have the capability of having multiple keys, this was harmless.
  This PR introduces a new way of generating that identifier, making it random and unique, so multiple room keys can be used on the same room as long as the keyID is different.

  NOTE: new E2EE rooms created _after_ this PR is merged will not be compatible with older versions of Rocket.Chat. Old rooms created before this update will continue to be compatible.

- ([#33361](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33361)) Change the E2EE setting - "Access unencrypted content in encrypted rooms" default value, making the current behavior not allow to send unencrypted messages in end-to-end encrypted channels.

- ([#33572](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33572)) Removes the ability of changing room's encryption status from the `key` icon placed on the room's header. Icon's purpose is now only informative, showing when a room uses E2EE. Use the kebab menu to enable/disable E2EE.

- ([#33432](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33432)) Removed deprecated methods `livechat:requestTranscript` and `livechat:discardTranscript`. Moving forward use `livechat/transcript/:rid` endpoint's POST and DELETE methods.

Previously we were shipping Alpine as an alternative flavor under the tag rocketchat/rocket.chat:{release}.alpine , we have been testing this for a while now so we're migrating to use the official one to Alpine.

  We'll still ship a Debian variant under the tag rocketchat/rocket.chat:{release}.debian.

  Now, the endpoint that returns users waiting for keys will return only users that don't have neither `E2EKey` nor `E2ESuggestedKey`.

## 7.0.0-rc.0

### Major Changes

- ([#33316](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33316)) Changes some displays to reflect new rules for private apps and adds a new modal before uploading a private app

- ([#32212](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32212)) Fixed broken translation in "Forgot Password" e-mail

- ([#33503](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33503)) Adds modal confirmation to enable and disable End-to-end encryption

  Adds a reset room key option to the modal that disables End-to-end encryption, this is useful when all the members of a room lose their room E2EE keys

- ([#33474](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33474)) Removes deprecated endpoint `pw.getPolicyReset`. Moving forward, use the `pw.getPolicy` endpoint.

- ([#32162](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32162)) As per MongoDB Lifecycle Schedules ([mongodb.com/legal/support-policy/lifecycles](https://www.mongodb.com/legal/support-policy/lifecycles)) we're removing official support to MongoDB version 4.4 that has reached end of life in February 2024.

  We recommend upgrading to at least MongoDB 6.0+, though 5.0 is still a supported version.

  Here are official docs on how to upgrade to some of the supported versions:

  - [mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/5.0-upgrade-replica-set](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/5.0-upgrade-replica-set/)
  - [mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/6.0-upgrade-replica-set](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/6.0-upgrade-replica-set/)
  - [mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/7.0-upgrade-replica-set](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/7.0-upgrade-replica-set/)

- ([#33333](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33333)) Login services button was not respecting the button color and text color settings. Implemented a fix to respect these settings and change the button colors accordingly.

  Added a warning on all settings which allow admins to change OAuth button colors, so that they can be alerted about WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) compliance.

- ([#32162](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32162)) Added MongoDB 7.0 support

- ([#33449](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33449)) Removes deprecated method `livechat:webhookTest`. Moving forward use the endpoint `livechat/webhook.test`.

- ([#33373](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33373)) This adjustment removes the deprecated method `livechat:searchAgent`. Moving forward, use `livechat/users/agent/:_id` endpoint.

- ([#33442](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33442)) Removes deprecated `livechat:getAnalyticsOverviewData` method. Moving forward use the `livechat/analytics/overview` endpoint.

- ([#31889](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31889)) Removed upsert behavior on `users.update` endpoint (`joinDefaultChannels` param or empty `userId` are not allowed anymore)

- ([#32159](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32159)) Api login should not suggest which credential is wrong (password/username)

  Failed login attemps will always return `Unauthorized` instead of the internal fail reason

- ([#31117](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31117)) Adds a new set of permissions to provide a more granular control for the creation and deletion of rooms within teams

  - `create-team-channel`: controls the creations of public rooms within teams, it is checked within the team's main room scope and overrides the global `create-c` permission check. That is, granting this permission to a role allows users to create channels in teams even if they do not have the permission to create channels globally;
  - `create-team-group`: controls the creations of private rooms within teams, it is checked within the team's main room scope and overrides the global `create-p` permission check. That is, granting this permission to a role allows users to create groups in teams even if they do not have the permission to create groups globally;
  - `delete-team-channel`: controls the deletion of public rooms within teams, it is checked within the team's main room scope and complements the global `delete-c` permission check. That is, users must have both permissions (`delete-c` in the channel scope and `delete-team-channel` in its team scope) in order to be able to delete a channel in a team;
  - `delete-team-group`: controls the deletion of private rooms within teams, it is checked within the team's main room scope and complements the global `delete-p` permission check. That is, users must have both permissions (`delete-p` in the group scope and `delete-team-group` in its team scope) in order to be able to delete a group in a team;;

  Renames `add-team-channel` permission (used for adding existing rooms to teams) to `move-room-to-team`, since it is applied to groups and channels.

- ([#33391](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33391)) Removed deprecated method `livechat:loginByToken`. Moving forward, use the endpoint `livechat/visitor/:token`.

- ([#33473](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33473)) Removes deprecated method `getPasswordPolicy`. Moving forward, use the endpoint `pw.getPolicy`.

- ([#33210](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33210)) Removes private App installation via URL method following a deprecation warning.

- ([#33429](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33429)) Removed deprecated methods `livechat:saveTrigger` and `livechat:removeTrigger`. Moving forward use the endpoints `livechat/triggers (POST)` and `livechat/triggers/:_id (DELETE)` respectively.

- ([#33465](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33465)) Removes deprecated method `addOAuthApp`. Moving forward, use the endpoint `oauth-apps.create` instead.

- ([#33472](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33472)) Removes deprecated `deleteMessage` method. Moving forward, use the `chat.delete` endpoint.

- ([#33447](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33447)) Removes deprecated method `livechat:saveInfo`. Moving forward use the enpoint `livechat/room/save.info`.

- ([#31438](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31438)) Upgrades the version of the Meteor framework to 3.0

  The main reason behind this is the upgrade of the Node.js version, where version 14 will be removed and version 20 will be used instead.

  Internally, significant changes have been made, mostly due to the removal of fibers.

  As a result, it was necessary to adapt our code to work with the new version.

  No functionality should have been affected by this, but if you are running Rocket.Chat in unconventional ways, please note that you need to upgrade your Node.js version.

- ([#33426](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33426)) Removed deprecated method `livechat:getNextAgent`. Moving forward, use the `livechat/agent.next/:token` endpoint.

- ([#33526](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33526)) Removes deprecated method `livechat:setDepartmentForVisitor`. Moving forward, use the endpoint `livechat/visitor`.

- ([#33241](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33241)) Adds restrictions to air-gapped environments without a license

- ([#33042](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33042)) Removes `view-history` permission due to lack of usage

- ([#33448](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33448)) Removes the deprecated method `livechat:saveAppearance`. Moving forward use the endpoint `livechat/appearance`.

- ([#33445](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33445)) Removes deprecated `livechat:getAgentOverviewData` method. Moving forward use `livechat/analytics/agent-overview` endpoint.

- ([#33444](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33444)) Removes deprecated method `livechat:setCustomField`. The custom fields can be directly set via the `livechat/visitor` endpoint.

- ([#33329](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33329)) Randomizes `e2eKeyId` generation instead of derive it from encoded key. Previously, we used the stringified & encoded version of the key to extract a keyID, however this generated the same keyID for all rooms. As we didn't use this keyID, and rooms didn't have the capability of having multiple keys, this was harmless.
  This PR introduces a new way of generating that identifier, making it random and unique, so multiple room keys can be used on the same room as long as the keyID is different.

  NOTE: new E2EE rooms created _after_ this PR is merged will not be compatible with older versions of Rocket.Chat. Old rooms created before this update will continue to be compatible.

- ([#33361](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33361)) Change the E2EE setting - "Access unencrypted content in encrypted rooms" default value, making the current behavior not allow to send unencrypted messages in end-to-end encrypted channels.

### Minor Changes

- ([#33156](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33156)) added `sidepanelNavigation` to feature preview list

- ([#32682](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32682)) Added support for specifying a unit on departments' creation and update

- ([#33139](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33139)) Added new setting `Allow visitors to finish conversations` that allows admins to decide if omnichannel visitors can close a conversation or not. This doesn't affect agent's capabilities of room closing, neither apps using the livechat bridge to close rooms.
  However, if currently your integration relies on `livechat/room.close` endpoint for closing conversations, it's advised to use the authenticated version `livechat/room.closeByUser` of it before turning off this setting.
- ([#32729](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32729)) Implemented "omnichannel/contacts.update" endpoint to update contacts

- ([#32510](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32510)) Added a new setting to enable mentions in end to end encrypted channels

- ([#32821](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32821)) Replaced new `SidebarV2` components under feature preview

- ([#33011](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33011)) Return `parent` and `team` information when calling `rooms.info` endpoint

- ([#32945](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32945)) Added a new setting which allows workspace admins to disable email two factor authentication for SSO (OAuth) users. If enabled, SSO users won't be asked for email two factor authentication.

- ([#33225](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33225)) Implemented new feature preview for Sidepanel

### Patch Changes

- ([#33317](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33317)) Fixed error during sendmessage client stub

- ([#33211](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33211)) Allow to use the token from `room.v` when requesting transcript instead of visitor token. Visitors may change their tokens at any time, rendering old conversations impossible to access for them (or for APIs depending on token) as the visitor token won't match the `room.v` token.

- ([#33298](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33298)) Fixed a Federation callback not awaiting db call

- ([#32999](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32999)) Fixes multiple selection for MultiStaticSelectElement in UiKit

- ([#33155](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33155)) Fixed a code issue on NPS service. It was passing `startAt` as the expiration date when creating a banner.

- ([#33237](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33237)) fixed retention policy max age settings not being respected after upgrade

- ([#33295](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33295)) Resolves the issue where outgoing integrations failed to trigger after the version 6.12.0 upgrade by correcting the parameter order from the `afterSaveMessage` callback to listener functions. This ensures the correct room information is passed, restoring the functionality of outgoing webhooks, IRC bridge, Autotranslate, and Engagement Dashboard.

- ([#33193](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33193)) Fixed avatar blob image setting in setUserAvatar method by correcting service handling logic.

- ([#33181](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33181)) Fixed issue that caused an infinite loading state when uploading a private app to Rocket.Chat

- ([#33158](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33158)) Fixes an issue where multi-step modals were closing unexpectedly

## 6.12.0

### Minor Changes

- ([#32535](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32535)) Federation actions like sending message in a federated DM, reacting in a federated chat, etc, will no longer work if the configuration is invalid.

- ([#32916](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32916)) Added a new Audit endpoint `audit/rooms.members` that allows users with `view-members-list-all-rooms` to fetch a list of the members of any room even if the user is not part of it.

- ([#32032](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32032)) Added a new 'Deactivated' tab to the users page, this tab lists users who have logged in for the first time but have been deactivated for any reason. Also added the UI code for the Active tab;

- ([#33044](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33044)) Replaces an outdated banner with the Bubble component in order to display retention policy warning

- ([#32867](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32867)) Added an accordion for advanced settings on Create teams and channels

- ([#32709](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32709) by [@heet434](https://github.com/heet434)) Add "Created at" column to admin rooms table

- ([#33003](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33003)) Added a new setting to enable/disable file encryption in an end to end encrypted room.

- ([#32868](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32868)) Added `sidepanel` field to `teams.create` and `rooms.saveRoomSettings` endpoints

- ([#33003](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33003)) Fixed a bug related to uploading end to end encrypted file.

  E2EE files and uploads are uploaded as files of mime type `application/octet-stream` as we can't reveal the mime type of actual content since it is encrypted and has to be kept confidential.

  The server resolves the mime type of encrypted file as `application/octet-stream` but it wasn't playing nicely with existing settings related to whitelisted and blacklisted media types.

  E2EE files upload was getting blocked if `application/octet-stream` is not a whitelisted media type.

  Now this PR solves this issue by always accepting E2EE uploads even if `application/octet-stream` is not whitelisted but it will block the upload if `application/octet-stream` is black listed.

- ([#33109](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33109)) Fixes the `expanded` prop being accidentally forwarded to `ContextualbarHeader`

- ([#32846](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32846)) Fixed issue with system messages being counted as agents' first responses in livechat rooms (which caused the "best first response time" and "average first response time" metrics to be unreliable for all agents)

- ([#32791](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32791)) Fixed a behavior when updating messages that prevented the `customFields` prop from being updated if there were no changes to the `msg` property. Now, `customFields` will be always updated on message update even if `msg` doesn't change

- ([#33169](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33169)) Fixed issue that prevented sending encrypted filed from the mobile app

- ([#33101](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33101)) Fixed an issue where teams were being created with no room associated with it.

- ([#33036](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33036)) Fixes multiple problems with the `processRoomAbandonment` hook. This hook is in charge of calculating the time a room has been abandoned (this means, the time that elapsed since a room was last answered by an agent until it was closed). However, when business hours were enabled and the user didn't open on one day, if an abandoned room happened to be abandoned _over_ the day there was no business hour configuration, then the process will error out.
  Additionally, the values the code was calculating were not right. When business hours are enabled, this code should only count the abandonment time _while a business hour was open_. When rooms were left abandoned for days or weeks, this will also throw an error or output an invalid count.

## 6.12.0-rc.0

### Minor Changes

- ([#32535](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32535)) Federation actions like sending message in a federated DM, reacting in a federated chat, etc, will no longer work if the configuration is invalid.

- ([#32916](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32916)) Added a new Audit endpoint `audit/rooms.members` that allows users with `view-members-list-all-rooms` to fetch a list of the members of any room even if the user is not part of it.

- ([#32032](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32032)) Added a new 'Deactivated' tab to the users page, this tab lists users who have logged in for the first time but have been deactivated for any reason. Also added the UI code for the Active tab;

- ([#33044](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33044)) Replaces an outdated banner with the Bubble component in order to display retention policy warning

- ([#32867](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32867)) Added an accordion for advanced settings on Create teams and channels

- ([#32709](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32709) by [@heet434](https://github.com/heet434)) Add "Created at" column to admin rooms table

- ([#32535](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32535)) New button added to validate Matrix Federation configuration. A new field inside admin settings will reflect the configuration status being either 'Valid' or 'Invalid'.

- ([#32969](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32969)) Upgrades fuselage-toastbar version in order to add pause on hover functionality

- ([#33003](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33003)) Added a new setting to enable/disable file encryption in an end to end encrypted room.

- ([#32868](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32868)) Added `sidepanel` field to `teams.create` and `rooms.saveRoomSettings` endpoints

- ([#33003](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33003)) Fixed a bug related to uploading end to end encrypted file.

  E2EE files and uploads are uploaded as files of mime type `application/octet-stream` as we can't reveal the mime type of actual content since it is encrypted and has to be kept confidential.

  The server resolves the mime type of encrypted file as `application/octet-stream` but it wasn't playing nicely with existing settings related to whitelisted and blacklisted media types.

  E2EE files upload was getting blocked if `application/octet-stream` is not a whitelisted media type.

  Now this PR solves this issue by always accepting E2EE uploads even if `application/octet-stream` is not whitelisted but it will block the upload if `application/octet-stream` is black listed.

  The new meteor 2.16 release introduced a new option to configure the Accounts package and choose between the local storage or session storage.

## 6.11.0

### Minor Changes

- ([#32498](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32498)) Created a `transferChat` Livechat API endpoint for transferring chats programmatically, the endpoint has all the limitations & permissions required that transferring via UI has

- ([#32792](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32792)) Allows admins to customize the `Subject` field of Omnichannel email transcripts via setting. By passing a value to the setting `Custom email subject for transcript`, system will use it as the `Subject` field, unless a custom subject is passed when requesting a transcript. If there's no custom subject and setting value is empty, the current default value will be used

- ([#32739](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32739)) Fixed an issue where FCM actions did not respect environment's proxy settings

- ([#32706](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32706)) Added the possibility for apps to remove users from a room

- ([#32517](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32517)) Feature Preview: New Navigation - `Header` and `Contextualbar` size improvements consistent with the new global `NavBar`

- ([#32493](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32493)) Fixed Livechat rooms being displayed in the Engagement Dashboard's "Channels" tab

- ([#32742](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32742)) Fixed an issue where adding `OVERWRITE_SETTING_` for any setting wasn't immediately taking effect sometimes, and needed a server restart to reflect.

- ([#32752](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32752)) Added system messages support for Omnichannel PDF transcripts and email transcripts. Currently these transcripts don't render system messages and is shown as an empty message in PDF/email. This PR adds this support for all valid livechat system messages.

  Also added a new setting under transcripts, to toggle the inclusion of system messages in email and PDF transcripts.

- ([#32793](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32793)) New Feature: Video Conference Persistent Chat.
  This feature provides a discussion id for conference provider apps to store the chat messages exchanged during the conferences, so that those users may then access those messages again at any time through Rocket.Chat.
- ([#32176](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32176)) Added a method to the Apps-Engine that allows apps to read multiple messages from a room

- ([#32493](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32493)) Improved Engagement Dashboard's "Channels" tab performance by not returning rooms that had no activity in the analyzed period

- ([#32024](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32024)) Implemented a new tab to the users page called 'Active', this tab lists all users who have logged in for the first time and are active.

- ([#32744](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32744)) Added account setting `Accounts_Default_User_Preferences_sidebarSectionsOrder` to allow users to reorganize sidebar sections

- ([#32820](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32820)) Added a new setting `Livechat_transcript_send_always` that allows admins to decide if email transcript should be sent all the times when a conversation is closed. This setting bypasses agent's preferences. For this setting to work, `Livechat_enable_transcript` should be off, meaning that visitors will no longer receive the option to decide if they want a transcript or not.

- ([#32724](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32724)) Extended apps-engine events for users leaving a room to also fire when being removed by another user. Also added the triggering user's information to the event's context payload.

- ([#32777](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32777)) Added handling of attachments in Omnichannel email transcripts. Earlier attachments were being skipped and were being shown as empty space, now it should render the image attachments and should show relevant error message for unsupported attachments.

- ([#32800](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32800)) Added the ability to filter chats by `queued` on the Current Chats Omnichannel page

A helper function was created to centralize the setting validation and the proper value being returned to avoid edge cases.
  Negative values may be saved on the settings UI panel but the code will interpret any negative, NaN or 0 value to the default expiration which is 90 days.
- ([#32626](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32626)) livechat `setDepartment` livechat api fixes:

Rocket.Chat needs service workers to process E2EE encrypted files on rooms. These types of files won't be available inside private windows, but the rest of E2EE encrypted features should work normally

- ([#32864](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32864)) fixed an issue in the "Create discussion" form, that would have the "Create" action button disabled even though the form is prefilled when opening it from the message action

This PR improves this and now the translations are loaded at the start and kept in memory to process further pdf transcripts requests. This reduces the time of asynchronously fetching translations again and again.

## 6.11.0-rc.0

### Minor Changes

- ([#32498](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32498)) Created a `transferChat` Livechat API endpoint for transferring chats programmatically, the endpoint has all the limitations & permissions required that transferring via UI has

- ([#32792](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32792)) Allows admins to customize the `Subject` field of Omnichannel email transcripts via setting. By passing a value to the setting `Custom email subject for transcript`, system will use it as the `Subject` field, unless a custom subject is passed when requesting a transcript. If there's no custom subject and setting value is empty, the current default value will be used

- ([#32739](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32739)) Fixed an issue where FCM actions did not respect environment's proxy settings

- ([#32570](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32570)) Login services button was not respecting the button color and text color settings. Implemented a fix to respect these settings and change the button colors accordingly.

  Added a warning on all settings which allow admins to change OAuth button colors, so that they can be alerted about WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) compliance.

- ([#32706](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32706)) Added the possibility for apps to remove users from a room

- ([#32517](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32517)) Feature Preview: New Navigation - `Header` and `Contextualbar` size improvements consistent with the new global `NavBar`

- ([#32493](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32493)) Fixed Livechat rooms being displayed in the Engagement Dashboard's "Channels" tab

- ([#32742](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32742)) Fixed an issue where adding `OVERWRITE_SETTING_` for any setting wasn't immediately taking effect sometimes, and needed a server restart to reflect.

- ([#32752](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32752)) Added system messages support for Omnichannel PDF transcripts and email transcripts. Currently these transcripts don't render system messages and is shown as an empty message in PDF/email. This PR adds this support for all valid livechat system messages.

  Also added a new setting under transcripts, to toggle the inclusion of system messages in email and PDF transcripts.

- ([#32793](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32793)) New Feature: Video Conference Persistent Chat.
  This feature provides a discussion id for conference provider apps to store the chat messages exchanged during the conferences, so that those users may then access those messages again at any time through Rocket.Chat.
- ([#32176](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32176)) Added a method to the Apps-Engine that allows apps to read multiple messages from a room

- ([#32493](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32493)) Improved Engagement Dashboard's "Channels" tab performance by not returning rooms that had no activity in the analyzed period

- ([#32024](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32024)) Implemented a new tab to the users page called 'Active', this tab lists all users who have logged in for the first time and are active.

- ([#32744](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32744)) Added account setting `Accounts_Default_User_Preferences_sidebarSectionsOrder` to allow users to reorganize sidebar sections

- ([#32820](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32820)) Added a new setting `Livechat_transcript_send_always` that allows admins to decide if email transcript should be sent all the times when a conversation is closed. This setting bypasses agent's preferences. For this setting to work, `Livechat_enable_transcript` should be off, meaning that visitors will no longer receive the option to decide if they want a transcript or not.

- ([#32724](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32724)) Extended apps-engine events for users leaving a room to also fire when being removed by another user. Also added the triggering user's information to the event's context payload.

- ([#32777](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32777)) Added handling of attachments in Omnichannel email transcripts. Earlier attachments were being skipped and were being shown as empty space, now it should render the image attachments and should show relevant error message for unsupported attachments.

- ([#32800](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32800)) Added the ability to filter chats by `queued` on the Current Chats Omnichannel page

- ([#32527](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32527)) Fixed an inconsistent evaluation of the `Accounts_LoginExpiration` setting over the codebase. In some places, it was being used as milliseconds while in others as days. Invalid values produced different results. A helper function was created to centralize the setting validation and the proper value being returned to avoid edge cases.
  Negative values may be saved on the settings UI panel but the code will interpret any negative, NaN or 0 value to the default expiration which is 90 days.
- ([#32626](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32626)) livechat `setDepartment` livechat api fixes:
  - Changing department didn't reflect on the registration form in real time
  - Changing the department mid conversation didn't transfer the chat
  - Depending on the state of the department, it couldn't be set as default

- ([#32713](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32713)) Fixed the disappearance of some settings after navigation under network latency.

- ([#32592](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32592)) Fixes Missing line breaks on Omnichannel Room Info Panel

- ([#32807](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32807)) Fixed web client crashing on Firefox private window. Firefox disables access to service workers inside private windows. Rocket.Chat needs service workers to process E2EE encrypted files on rooms. These types of files won't be available inside private windows, but the rest of E2EE encrypted features should work normally

- ([#32864](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32864)) fixed an issue in the "Create discussion" form, that would have the "Create" action button disabled even though the form is prefilled when opening it from the message action

- ([#32857](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32857)) Fixed some anomalies related to disabled E2EE rooms. Earlier there are some weird issues with disabled E2EE rooms, this PR fixes these anomalies.

- ([#32765](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32765)) Fixed an issue that prevented the option to start a discussion from being shown on the message actions

Earlier Rocket.Chat was fetching the required translations everytime a PDF transcript was requested, this process was async and was being unnecessarily being performed on every pdf transcript request. This PR improves this and now the translations are loaded at the start and kept in memory to process further pdf transcripts requests. This reduces the time of asynchronously fetching translations again and again.

- ([#32719](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32719)) Added the `user` param to apps-engine update method call, allowing apps' new `onUpdate` hook to know who triggered the update.

- ([#32040](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32040)) Introduced a new setting which doesn't allow users to access encrypted rooms until E2EE is configured and also doesn't allow users to send un-encrypted messages in encrypted rooms.

## 6.9.0

### Minor Changes

- ([#31917](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31917)) Introduced a tab layout to the users page and implemented a tab called "All" that lists all users.

- ([#32439](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32439)) Allow visitors & integrations to access downloaded files after a room has closed. This was a known limitation in our codebase, where visitors were only able to access uploaded files in a livechat conversation while the conversation was open.

- ([#32233](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32233)) Makes the triggers fired by the condition `after-guest-registration` persist on the livechat client, it will persist through reloads and pagination, only reseting when a conversation is closed (no changes were done on the agent side of the conversation)

- ([#32193](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32193)) Adds CheckOption to departments multi selects improving options visibility state

- ([#32317](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32317)) Replace the read receipt receipt indicator in order to improve the accessibility complience

- ([#32341](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32341)) Changes the scrollbar color in order to improve the contrast and accessibility compliance

- ([#32298](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32298)) Added "Rocket.Chat Cloud Workspace ID" to workspace statistics page

### Patch Changes

- ([#32393](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32393)) Fixed an issue causing monitors to dissapear from a saved unit every time a user saved the item. This was caused by the UI not sending the correct \_id of the monitors that were already saved, and this caused the Backend to ignore them and remove from the list.

- ([#31695](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31695)) Fix an issue where read receipts menu item wasn't considering the enabled setting to be displayed

- Bump @rocket.chat/meteor version.

- Bump @rocket.chat/meteor version.

- Bump @rocket.chat/meteor version.

- ([#32454](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32454)) Fixes an issue not allowing override retention policy in channels

- ([#32444](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32444)) Fixed an issue that prevented CAS users from being merged with existing user data on login

- ([#32289](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32289)) Fixed a problem in how server was processing errors that was sending 2 ephemeral error messages when @all or @here were used while they were disabled via permissions

- ([#32348](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32348)) Fixed an issue where translations would fallback to english some of the times.

- ([#32182](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32182)) Fixed an issue with object storage settings that was not allowing admins to decide if files generated via "Export conversation" feature were being proxied through server or not.

- ([#32311](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32311)) Fixed multiple issues with PDF generation logic when a quoted message was too big to fit in one single page. This was causing an internal infinite loop within the library (as it tried to make it fit, failing and then trying to fit on next page where the same happened thus causing a loop).
  The library was not able to break down some nested views and thus was trying to fit the whole quote on one single page. Logic was updated to allow wrapping of the contents when messages are quoted (so they can span multiple lines) and removed a bunch of unnecesary views from the code.
- ([#32364](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32364)) Fixed issue with "Export room as file" feature (`rooms.export` endpoint) generating an empty export when given an invalid date

- ([#32314](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32314)) Fixed an issue on Users converter that was not returning the `statusText` property from users even when the typing indicated property existed.

- ([#32500](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32500)) Fix user not being set as online when setting "Use REST instead of websocket for Meteor calls" is disabled

- ([#32391](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32391)) Fixes link image preview not opening in gallery mode

- ([#32318](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32318)) Fixed error handling for files bigger than NATS max allowed payload. This should prevent PDFs from erroring out when generating from rooms that contain heavy images.

- ([#32479](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32479)) Executing a logout and login action in the same "tab/instance", some streams were not being recreated, causing countless types of bugs.

  PS: as a workaround reloading after logout or login in also solves the problem.

- ([#32345](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32345)) Replaces the burger menu with an appropriate button fixing the semantics and mismatching color

- ([#32414](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32414)) Fixes the missing spacing on don`t ask again checkbox inside modals

- ([#32269](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32269)) Fixed a bad behavior with the interaction between OTR system messages & trash collection. We use trash collection as a temporary storage that holds recently deleted items from some collections. Messages is one of those. This was causing "User joined OTR" messages to be viewable when querying the trash collection.
  Since OTR messages are by definition private, code was updated to bypass trash collection when removing these special messages.

  Note: this only applies to these system messages. OTR user's messages are not stored on the database.

- ([#32415](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32415)) This fuselage`s bump fixes:

  - The message toolbar visibility on hover (Firefox ESR)
  - `Bubble` missing font-family

  [more details](https://github.com/RocketChat/fuselage/releases/tag/%40rocket.chat%2Ffuselage%400.53.7)

- ([#32398](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32398)) Fixed issue with external users being able to reset their passwords even when the "Allow Password Change for OAuth Users" setting is disabled

- ([#32284](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32284)) fixed Engagement Dashboard and Device Management admin pages loading indefinitely

- Bump @rocket.chat/meteor version.

- Bump @rocket.chat/meteor version.

- Bump @rocket.chat/meteor version.

- ([#32186](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32186)) Increased the timeout between calls for the three remaining Omnichannel Agenda Jobs. This should make them happen less often and reduce the load on MongoDB

- ([#32216](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32216)) Fixed an issue while creating tokens via the special `users.createToken` API was not respecting the maximum login tokens allowed for a user.

  - `/api/v1/users.createToken`

  The following Meteor method (realtime API) was deprecated and will be removed on version `8.0.0`:

  - `createToken`

- ([#32063](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32063)) Fixed a UI issue that allowed a user to "mark" a room as favorite even when a room was not default. The Back-End was correctly ignoring the `favorite` property from being updated when the room was not default, but the UI still allowed users to try.
  As UI allowed but changes were not saved, this gave the impression that the function was not working.
- ([#32374](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32374)) Fixed an issue with some apps that didn't implement executeViewCloseHandler. This causes opened modals to be open forever on UI (unless Esc was clicked). This is because when the UI attempts to close it, it calls the aforementioned handler, and since it didn't exist, apps engine errored out.

  This returned an empty response to the UI, which ignored the response and continued to show the view.

- ([#32237](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32237)) **Fixed settings-related statistics not being updated according to the license.**

- ([#32141](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32141)) Deprecate `channels.images` in favor of `rooms.images`. `Rooms` endpoints are more broad and should interact with all types of rooms. `Channels` on the other hand are specific to public channels.
  This change is to keep the semantics and conventions of the endpoints
- ([#32157](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32157)) Fixed custom OAuth roles not synced on the first login (on user creation)

- ([#32230](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32230)) Fixed a problem that caused OTR Session messages' to not being transmitted from one peer to another when running Rocket.Chat as microservices.

- ([#32021](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32021)) Fixed duplicate API calls during livechat room forwarding by adding loading state for submit button

- ([#30309](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/30309)) Fixed a problem that caused `afterCreateUser` callback to be called without new user's roles inside. This caused Omnichannel Business Hour manager to ignore these users from assigning open business hours until the manager restarted or the business hour restarted.

- ([#32172](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32172)) Fixes an issue where message reactions are vertically misaligned when zooming out

- ([#32062](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32062)) Fixed an issue where old exports would get overwritten by new ones if generated on the same day, when using external storage services (such as Amazon S3)

- ([#31745](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31745) by [@Pritam-sd-dev](https://github.com/Pritam-sd-dev)) Fix room name updation on admin edit room flow.

- ([#31948](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31948) by [@hardikbhatia777](https://github.com/hardikbhatia777)) Fixes an issue not allowing edit webhooks properly

- ([#31909](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31909)) fix: Trigger `IPostLivechatRoomStarted` app event after inquiry is created. Previously, this event was fired after a room was created. This allowed to do some actions on rooms, but more elevated actions like transfering a room were not possible as at this point, an inquiry didn't exist.

- ([#31881](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31881)) Fixed a problem that caused Business Hours feature (Multiple) to make bot agents not available when turning on the feature, and not making them available after that.

- ([#31970](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31970)) **Fixed enterprise settings value not being updated when license is removed or invalid**

  Added a license callbacks `onRemoveLicense` and `onInvalidateLicense` to update enterprise settings values when a license is removed/invalid.
  This solves a specific scenario where in case of a downgrade (license removal), `settings.get` would continue to return `value` for enterprise settings instead of `invalidValue` as it should.
  This would remain the case until the workspace was restarted.

- ([#31844](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31844)) Fixed Federation not working with Microservice deployments

- ([#31927](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31927)) `stopped` lifecycle method was unexpectedly synchronous when using microservices, causing our code to create race conditions.

- ([#31880](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31880)) fix: CRM integration mismatch on callback type vs code validation. Previously, callback was attempting to register a `LivechatStarted` event, however, our internal code was expecting a `LivechatStart` event, causing the hook to receive incomplete data

- ([#31600](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31600)) Looking at the user's permission before rendering the 'Start Call' button on the UserInfo panel, so if the user does not have the permissions, the button does not show

- ([#31904](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31904)) fix: Show always all rooms when requesting chat history, even unserved ones. A faulty condition caused an issue where chat history was only able to present either served or unserved chats at once, without a proper way to get both. Now, the Chat history feature will showcase all closed rooms for the requested visitor.

- ([#31896](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31896)) fix: Validate rooms are not taken before processing by queue. This will prevent an issue that caused a room, that's on an invalid state, to be re-processed by the queue worker, assigning it again to another user despite being already assigned to one. This happens when a room's inquiry gets to an state where it desyncs from the room object. Room is taken & served while inquiry is still queued. This fix will also reconciliate both when something like this happens: whenever the queue picks a chat that's already taken, it will update it's inquiry object to reflect that and avoid processing again.

- ([#31823](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31823)) Revert unintentional changes real time presence data payload

- ([#31604](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31604)) Fixed an issue where the sync ldap avatars background process would never run

- ([#31621](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31621)) Improved the layout of the 2FA modals and changed the email 2FA resend email anchor to a button.

- ([#32038](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32038)) **Added tag to premium settings in CE workspaces**

  A premium tag will be displayed alongside the setting label for premium exclusive settings in CE workspaces.
  This will bring visibility for users of our premium features while also informing them of the reason why the setting is currently disabled.

- ([#31998](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31998)) Introduced a new step to the queue worker: when an inquiry that's on an improper status is selected for processing, queue worker will first check its status and will attempt to fix it.
  For example, if an inquiry points to a closed room, there's no point in processing, system will now remove the inquiry
  If an inquiry is already taken, the inquiry will be updated to reflect the new status and clean the queue.

  This prevents issues where the queue worker attempted to process an inquiry _forever_ because it was in an improper state.

- ([#32056](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32056)) Fix error during migration 304. Throwing `Cannot read property 'finally' of undefined` error.

- ([#31658](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31658)) Fixes an issue where messages are not updating properly after pruning the room

- ([#32043](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32043)) **Added Livechat's new theming settings to Appearance page (available for Premium workspaces)**

- ([#31538](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31538)) Introduced new methods for Rocket.Chat Apps to interact with livechat: `findOpenRoomsByAgentId` and `countOpenRoomsByAgentId`

### Patch Changes

- ([#31663](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31663)) Fixes issue causing the setDepartment Livechat API overriding some triggers conditions

- ([#31745](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31745) by [@Pritam-sd-dev](https://github.com/Pritam-sd-dev)) Fix room name updation on admin edit room flow.

- ([#31948](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31948) by [@hardikbhatia777](https://github.com/hardikbhatia777)) Fixes an issue not allowing edit webhooks properly

- ([#31909](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31909)) fix: Trigger `IPostLivechatRoomStarted` app event after inquiry is created. Previously, this event was fired after a room was created. This allowed to do some actions on rooms, but more elevated actions like transfering a room were not possible as at this point, an inquiry didn't exist.

- ([#31881](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31881)) Fixed a problem that caused Business Hours feature (Multiple) to make bot agents not available when turning on the feature, and not making them available after that. Now, Business Hours will ignore Bot users, allowing admins to decide manually if a bot should be or not be active during a period of time

- ([#31720](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31720)) Now we are considering channels with auto-join inside teams on user creation

- ([#31970](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31970)) **Fixed enterprise settings value not being updated when license is removed or invalid**

  Added a license callbacks `onRemoveLicense` and `onInvalidateLicense` to update enterprise settings values when a license is removed/invalid.
  This solves a specific scenario where in case of a downgrade (license removal), `settings.get` would continue to return `value` for enterprise settings instead of `invalidValue` as it should.
  This would remain the case until the workspace was restarted.

- ([#31973](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31973) by [@VipinDevelops](https://github.com/VipinDevelops)) Fixed message composer command preview for text type

- ([#31723](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31723)) fixed an issue with the user presence not updating automatically for other users.

- ([#31894](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31894)) fixed a small issue that was causing the room layout to shift when loading apps messages

- ([#32019](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32019)) Allowed upload of `lst` files

- ([#32012](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32012)) Don't use the registration.yaml file to configure Matrix Federation anymore.

- ([#32031](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32031)) Fixes issue where the livechat offline form would render even when disabled

- ([#31554](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31554) by [@shivang-16](https://github.com/shivang-16)) Fixed a bug on the rooms page's "Favorite" setting, which previously failed to designate selected rooms as favorites by default.

- ([#31844](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31844)) Fixed Federation not working with Microservice deployments

- ([#31927](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31927)) `stopped` lifecycle method was unexpectedly synchronous when using microservices, causing our code to create race conditions.

- ([#31880](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31880)) fix: CRM integration mismatch on callback type vs code validation. Previously, callback was attempting to register a `LivechatStarted` event, however, our internal code was expecting a `LivechatStart` event, causing the hook to receive incomplete data

- ([#31600](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31600)) Looking at the user's permission before rendering the 'Start Call' button on the UserInfo panel, so if the user does not have the permissions, the button does not show

- ([#31904](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31904)) fix: Show always all rooms when requesting chat history, even unserved ones. A faulty condition caused an issue where chat history was only able to present either served or unserved chats at once, without a proper way to get both. Now, the Chat history feature will showcase all closed rooms for the requested visitor.

- ([#31896](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31896)) fix: Validate rooms are not taken before processing by queue. This will prevent an issue that caused a room, that's on an invalid state, to be re-processed by the queue worker, assigning it again to another user despite being already assigned to one. This happens when a room's inquiry gets to an state where it desyncs from the room object. Room is taken & served while inquiry is still queued. This fix will also reconciliate both when something like this happens: whenever the queue picks a chat that's already taken, it will update it's inquiry object to reflect that and avoid processing again.

- ([#31823](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31823)) Revert unintentional changes real time presence data payload

- ([#31604](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31604)) Fixed an issue where the sync ldap avatars background process would never run

- ([#31621](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31621)) Improved the layout of the 2FA modals and changed the email 2FA resend email anchor to a button.

- ([#32038](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32038)) **Added tag to premium settings in CE workspaces**

  A premium tag will be displayed alongside the setting label for premium exclusive settings in CE workspaces.
  This will bring visibility for users of our premium features while also informing them of the reason why the setting is currently disabled.

- ([#31998](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31998)) Introduced a new step to the queue worker: when an inquiry that's on an improper status is selected for processing, queue worker will first check its status and will attempt to fix it.
  For example, if an inquiry points to a closed room, there's no point in processing, system will now remove the inquiry
  If an inquiry is already taken, the inquiry will be updated to reflect the new status and clean the queue.

  This prevents issues where the queue worker attempted to process an inquiry _forever_ because it was in an improper state.

- ([#32056](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32056)) Fix error during migration 304. Throwing `Cannot read property 'finally' of undefined` error.

- ([#31658](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31658)) Fixes an issue where messages are not updating properly after pruning the room

- ([#31895](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31895)) Fix users presence stuck as online after connecting using mobile apps

- ([#31833](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31833)) Fix web UI not showing users presence updating to offline

### Patch Changes

- Bump @rocket.chat/meteor version.

- Bump @rocket.chat/meteor version.

- ([#31998](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31998)) Introduced a new step to the queue worker: when an inquiry that's on an improper status is selected for processing, queue worker will first check its status and will attempt to fix it.
  For example, if an inquiry points to a closed room, there's no point in processing, system will now remove the inquiry
  If an inquiry is already taken, the inquiry will be updated to reflect the new status and clean the queue.

  This prevents issues where the queue worker attempted to process an inquiry _forever_ because it was in an improper state.

- 2f8c98f7a8: Fixes an issue where texts are not being displayed in the correct direction on messages
- 1ccfc5d1a0: Fixed a problem with the Fallback Forward Department functionality when transferring rooms, caused by a missing return.

- faf4121927: Fixed a problem that caused the wrong system message to be sent when a chat was resumed from on hold status.
  Note: This fix is not retroactive so rooms where a wrong message was already sent will still show the wrong message. New calls to the resume actions will have the proper message.

- 9c59a87c45: Fixed an issue where room access and creation were hindered due to join codes not being fetched correctly in the API.
- 75d235ada7: Added missing labels to "Users by time of the day" card at Engagement Dashboard page

- b4b2cd20a8: Fixed an issue caused by the `Fallback Forward Department` feature. Feature could be configured by admins in a way that mimis a loop, causing a chat to be forwarded "infinitely" between those departments.

  +----- push gateway changed = 0b100 = 4
  ```

  The fingerprint is composed by `${siteUrl}${dbConnectionString}` and hashed via `sha256` in `base64`.
  An environment variable named `AUTO_ACCEPT_FINGERPRINT`, when set to `true`, can be used to auto-accept an expected fingerprint change as a regular deployment update.
- 5f81a0f3cb: Implemented the License library, it is used to handle the functionality like expiration date, modules, limits, etc.

- 3ce070a3de: fix: wrong client hash calculation due to race condition on assets

  Some deployments may suffer from some reloads if running multiple instances. It's caused by different client hashes generated due to a possible race condition on custom assets load at the startup time. Forcing the clients to talk to the right backend instances, which causes reloads if sticky sessions are not enabled.
  This change removes the assets from the hash calculation preventing the race condition and possible different hashes. After this change, the clients will not reload when the admin changes assets.

- ad7e52b742: Enable the option `Only allow verified users to login` to SaaS environment
- 8668485fda: fix: immediate auto reload issues

  Immediate auto reload increases server load on restarts/upgrades and increases the chance of getting 404 on Meteor's config file blocking the UI on a loading screen

  This change adds delays on front and backend codes on automatic client reload:

  - Front-end, adds a warning message including the old and new hashes, and a delay of 60 seconds after being notified by the server
  - Back-end, delays the client notifications on a random value between 2 and 10 minutes per connection, allowing different clients to reload at different moments and distributing the load along the time.

### Patch Changes

- Bump @rocket.chat/meteor version.
- 3ce070a3de: fix: wrong client hash calculation due to race condition on assets

  Some deployments may suffer from some reloads if running multiple instances. It's caused by different client hashes generated due to a possible race condition on custom assets load at the startup time. Forcing the clients to talk to the right backend instances, which causes reloads if sticky sessions are not enabled.
  This change removes the assets from the hash calculation preventing the race condition and possible different hashes. After this change, the clients will not reload when the admin changes assets.

## 6.5.0-rc.3

### Patch Changes

- Bump @rocket.chat/meteor version.
- 8668485fda: fix: immediate auto reload issues

  Immediate auto reload increases server load on restarts/upgrades and increases the chance of getting 404 on Meteor's config file blocking the UI on a loading screen

  This change adds delays on front and backend codes on automatic client reload:

  - Front-end, adds a warning message including the old and new hashes, and a delay of 60 seconds after being notified by the server
  - Back-end, delays the client notifications on a random value between 2 and 10 minutes per connection, allowing different clients to reload at different moments and distributing the load along the time.

## 6.4.6

### Patch Changes

- 35ea15005a: Bump @rocket.chat/meteor version.
- Bump @rocket.chat/meteor version.
- 57deb49ceb: fix: OAuth login by redirect failing on firefox
- 00875fc9ab: fix: wrong client hash calculation due to race condition on assets

  Some deployments may suffer from some reloads if running multiple instances. It's caused by different client hashes generated due to a possible race condition on custom assets load at the startup time. Forcing the clients to talk to the right backend instances, which causes reloads if sticky sessions are not enabled.
  This change removes the assets from the hash calculation preventing the race condition and possible different hashes. After this change, the clients will not reload when the admin changes assets.

- b7ea8651bf: fix: immediate auto reload issues

  Immediate auto reload increases server load on restarts/upgrades and increases the chance of getting 404 on Meteor's config file blocking the UI on a loading screen

  This change adds delays on front and backend codes on automatic client reload:

  - Front-end, adds a warning message including the old and new hashes, and a delay of 60 seconds after being notified by the server
  - Back-end, delays the client notifications on a random value between 2 and 10 minutes per connection, allowing different clients to reload at different moments and distributing the load along the time.
